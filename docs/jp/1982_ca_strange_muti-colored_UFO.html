<pre>
now i want to talk  about the third case which i think is the most  
22:21
dramatic case and i call this case missing time  on highway five the main witness is keith boyer  
22:31
that it is a pseudonym uh and he had a  friend along with him they were driving  
22:39
from los angeles to san francisco along highway  5 in 1982 and they were about half way between  
22:50
la and san francisco in the middle of the  central valley sort of near the fresno area  
22:57
and uh it was late at night around 2 a.m  there was very little traffic on the road  
23:04
they were moving at about a good clip of about  70 miles per hour when looking ahead of them  
23:12
they saw something very strange on the road it was  a bright bright multi-colored object surrounded by  
23:21
this weird foggy mist now keith had always been  interested in ufos he&apos;s read a number of books so  
23:30
he was super excited and he gave a very really  really good description about what he saw so i  
23:37
just like to quote keith extensively and let him  describe in his own words what happened as he says  
23:48
i was driving through the central valley on  interstate 5 and i was approximately halfway   between san francisco and l.a i was with a good  friend who is a very hard-headed individual  
23:59
a firm pillar of the community type not given to  hysteria or anything and i probably wouldn&apos;t tell  
24:07
you the story and wouldn&apos;t even be thinking  about it a whole lot anymore if this guy   hadn&apos;t been with me but we were driving down the  road and sure enough there was something strange  
24:18
hovering on the horizon as we were driving towards  it it appeared to be some kind of flashing light  
24:24
something that was hovering over the freeway well  we drove along towards it and you know everyone  
24:31
drives through the central valley at 70 miles per  hour there wasn&apos;t a car behind us and not much  
24:37
traffic on the road at all really it was 2 a.m  and so the object was pretty indescribable from  
24:44
a distance the colors and lights seemed rather  striking and the conversation turned to what is  
24:52
that well it might be a plane flying along and  maybe it&apos;s a police patrol or something no it&apos;s  
24:59
pretty bright well maybe it&apos;s a crop duster plane  so as this conversation progresses we&apos;re heading  
25:06
directly towards this object which apparently is  a hundred feet off the ground above the freeway  
25:12
on our side of the freeway and as we got  closer to it more and more details became clear  
25:20
the object was a series of lights seemingly  merging and rotating into each other  
25:26
with a kind of indefinable mist surrounding  the object a fuzzy atmospheric phenomenon  
25:33
at this point the conversation between my friend  and i became extremely animated and it was like  
25:41
well maybe it&apos;s a crop dusting helicopter no that  theory was rejected because there aren&apos;t any crop  
25:48
dusting helicopters that i&apos;ve ever heard of so  we&apos;re continuing to drive over towards this object  
25:54
which is now beginning to move over to the  right of the freeway but it is also descending
26:02
at this point keith and his friend hadn&apos;t felt  any fear they were just pretty excited about it  
26:11
keith always likes to drive by the way he will not  get into a car unless he is driving this fact will  
26:18
become important later but i&apos;ll just let keith  continue describing what happened as keith says as  
26:26
we continued to zoom towards this object the light  became almost uncomfortably bright very odd colors  
26:35
deep rich blues greens yellows reds a number  of them shifting and merging into each other  
26:45
and this ominous looking fog or  mist surrounded the whole thing   it was hard to make out an outline of anything  so our conversation became extremely agitated  
26:56
at this point as i remember constant you  know both talking virtually at the same time  
27:02
comparing notes about what we thought this thing  was and as the object descended and as we began  
27:09
to draw abreast of it it was maybe a hundred feet  over the side of the freeway and landing and it  
27:15
seemed to be kicking up dust or maybe it was more  fog or whatever the object seems surrounded by  
27:21
fog or haze a hazy mist kind of cloudy white kind  of swirling tendrils of stuff so at this point i  
27:30
perceived that the object was unlike anything i  could possibly explain rationally with what i know  
27:37
and having spent years studying the topic of  ufos it seemed clear to me that i was finally  
27:43
seeing a genuine ufo and unlike what i thought my  reaction would be one of they do exist yay hooray  
27:52
i felt horror this was something that seemed to  me at the time that was not only reading my mind  
27:59
and knew everything about me but i was no more  than a bug to it maybe an interesting type of bug  
28:06
but this is my perception of what the object  was it seemed to me that the object wasn&apos;t a  
28:12
spaceship is almost something that was an entity  into itself unto itself so my friend and i are  
28:19
continuing to observe this object and as we draw  a rest of it in its landing my reaction was to  
28:25
get the hell away from this thing i always  thought my reaction would be here is a very  
28:31
interesting thing that has befuddled hundreds  of thousands of americans and people all over   the world and i&apos;m actually privileged to see one  let&apos;s stop the car walk over and knock on the door  
28:43
it was nothing like that it was an odd and  terrifying bright object that was scary and  
28:50
i wanted to get away from it as fast as possible  because with what i had read of ufo effects is  
28:57
there does seem to be a rather harmful effect some  people have been burned and have been affected  
29:02
negatively by ufo presences so my response was as  i said to get away uh keith is not quite sure how  
29:14
big this thing was as he says it&apos;s hard to  tell because the perspective of the object  
29:20
kept shifting and the light in the mist made  for a very confusing effect but i had to make  
29:27
if i had to make a very rough ballpark guess  i&apos;d say maybe 50 feet across and 50 feet wide  
29:33
roughly circular but oozing changing  transmogrifying it was a profoundly disturbing  
29:41
sight because it could not be explained by the  brain the brain kept trying to impose things like  
29:46
helicopters or airplanes as explanations but there  were no explanations and that was when the shock  
29:54
began here was a completely inexplicable object  disturbing i mean distressing it bothers one
30:06
so they were pretty uh fearful at this time and uh  
30:13
just totally entranced and watching this object  and this is when they apparently had missing time
30:26
because as keith says the next thing i remember  he his friend was driving and at that point  
30:36
a very strange phenomenon began happening  instead of speaking to each other in english  
30:43
we began babbling speaking  in tongues it&apos;s been called  
30:48
and it was a profoundly disturbing experience  it seemed right at the time but there was also  
30:55
a part of the brain that was observing  all of this and going well what the hell  
31:01
are you doing so that continued for about  10 or 15 minutes afterwards the effect  
31:08
seemed to slowly wear off and we numbly continued  our drive into the san francisco bay where i lived
31:19
so after returning home they did not discuss it  not not for some time and it was about a year  
31:26
later that they finally uh mentioned it to each  other and this is when another very strange thing  
31:34
happened as uh keith says and i quote now we  get to a very interesting thing my friend told  
31:43
me about a year later about a beam that had come  out of the object and i had forgotten all about  
31:50
it which is odd but as one studies these things  one finds that there is missing time and so forth  
31:57
but at this point i don&apos;t remember any more than  suddenly realizing that my friend was driving and  
32:03
i wasn&apos;t which is odd because i&apos;m a very obsessive  driver who loves to drive and always drives  
32:11
and he described this beam that came out of the  object and swept across the field towards us  
32:18
well when he said that i had a horrible memory  of it i remember neither of us wanted to get  
32:24
hit by that beam but it hit us at that point both  keith and his friend blacked out when this being  
32:33
struck their car this is when they actually  had missing time uh and neither of them  
32:40
really remember what happened during this missing  time though keith did have a few flashbacks as he  
32:47
says it was funny i was driving and then suddenly  he was driving i can&apos;t explain that not very well  
32:55
i seem to i don&apos;t know do i have memories  of stopping the car and shuffling around  
33:02
i don&apos;t remember we were very upset both of  us were very upset by the sight of the thing
33:11
so following this encounter uh keith did have  a very strong reaction it chained him changed  
33:20
him profoundly and in fact it completely  altered the path of his life he quit his job  
33:30
he left his girlfriend he ended up going to school  to pursue the profession he always wanted to do  
33:36
which was being a disc jockey on a radio station  and he feels that this encounter although scary  
33:43
at first was ultimately beneficial because it  really led to a huge spiritual awakening for him  
33:50
and as keith says and i quote this  is another thing that seems not   uncommon when one studies these things ufo  encounters often change a person&apos;s life  
34:01
in my case it was for the better  so whether there was actually any   effect i can&apos;t prove but i suspect that there was  some kind of an interaction between the object  
34:12
and myself and my friend and certainly at this  point i feel like the encounter was beneficial  
34:18
but i remember feeling great horror and fear up  to the point that i don&apos;t remember anymore like  
34:24
an animal that was trapped and wanted to get away  from a superior force that was incomprehensible
34:33
keith did consider hypnosis but as he says i&apos;ve  thought about it but i don&apos;t know any hypnotist  
34:40
i can trust i really am reluctant to pay some  hypnosis i don&apos;t know how to hypnotize me the  
34:48
whole effect of hypnosis to me i don&apos;t trust it  so if there was someone i knew someone recommended  
34:55
who was good who could be vouched for but right  now i&apos;m reluctant to tamper with it any further  
35:02
to tell you the truth i have a horrible  feeling that there was more to it   and i really would like not to know about it  so this is an effect a reaction that i&apos;ve heard  
35:14
from many other people who have missing time  they&apos;re afraid of opening up a can of worms  
35:20
they feel like their encounter was benevolent  and they&apos;re scared of what they might   uncover that&apos;s certainly true in keith&apos;s case his  friend however has gone much farther to try to  
35:35
not think about this as keith says every once  in a while my friends and i get together and  
35:42
we&apos;ll look at each other and say what  was that thing and the topic will change
35:50
last i heard keith actually ended up moving to  hawaii and was living in a cave and stocking up  
36:01
food and preparing for quote the end times  he really believes like many contactees  
36:11
that our earth is coming up for some  major major environmental disasters  
36:18
and uh that people need to stock up food and water  and there could very well be widespread loss of  
36:25
life i hear this quite often so i wasn&apos;t actually  that surprised when i heard that this is how keith  
36:33
is has reacted to all of this so even though  he doesn&apos;t remember what actually happened  
36:42
when he during this missing time  when he was presumably taken on board   i suspect his reactions has something to  do with this that he was given warnings  
36:52
of environmental disaster because that is  the number one message i hear from people

さて、3つ目のケースは最もドラマチックなケースだと思います。 
5号線のミッシング・タイムです 主な目撃者はキース・ボイヤー、仮名です<br>仮名ですが......彼には友人がいて、1982年にハイウェイ5号線でロサンゼルスからサンフランシスコまでドライブしていました。 
1982年、ロサンゼルスからサンフランシスコまでハイウェイ5をドライブしていました。 
ラとサンフランシスコの中間地点でセントラル・バレーのフレスノ付近だったんです<br>夜遅く午前2時頃で交通量は少なく<br>彼らは時速70マイルで 快調に走っていました その時 前方を見ると<br>道路に奇妙なものが見えたんです。 
キースはUFOに興味があり、本も何冊も読んでいましたので<br>彼はとても興奮していて、何を見たかについて、とてもとても上手に説明してくれました。 
キースの言葉を引用し彼の言葉で説明したいと思います。 
私はセントラルバレーの州道5号線を走っていた。サンフランシスコとロサンゼルスのほぼ中間に位置する。 
ヒステリーを起こすようなことはしないタイプです。 
もしこの人が一緒にいなかったら、この話はしなかったでしょうし、もうこのことについて深く考えることもなかったでしょう。しかし、私たちは道を運転していました。 
水平線に浮かんでいる光です。 
フリーウェイの上に浮かんでいるようなものでした。 
セントラルバレーを時速70マイルで走っているのですが、私たちの後ろには車は一台もなく、道路もそれほど混んでいませんでした。 
その時、夜中の2時だったので、その物体は遠くから見ると何とも言えないものでした。 
色と光はかなり印象的で、会話は何だろうということになった。 
それは......飛行機かもしれないし、警察のパトロールか何かかもしれない......いや、それは......。 
この会話が進むにつれて、私たちはこの物体に直接向かうようになった。 
この物体はどうやらフリーウェイの上、地上から100フィート（約1.5メートル）のところにあるようだ。 
その物体に近づくにつれ、より多くの詳細が明らかになった。 
その物体は、一見、互いに融合し回転しているように見える一連の光であり<br>そして、その物体の周りには、はっきりしない霧のようなものがあり、曖昧な大気現象であった。 
このとき、私と友人の会話は非常に活発になり、次のようになりました。 
この時、私と友人の会話は非常に盛り上がり、「これは農薬散布用のヘリコプターではないか？ 
そのため、私たちはこの物体に向かって車を走らせ続けました。 
その物体はフリーウェイの右側に移動し始めましたが、同時に下降しています。
この時点では、キースと彼の友人は何の恐怖も感じず、ただただ興奮していました。 
キースはいつも運転が好きで、自分が運転するとき以外は車に乗りません。 
後で重要になりますが、キースの説明を続けましょう。 
私たちはその物体に向かってズームアップし続けました。光はほとんど不快なほど明るくなり、とても奇妙な色になりました。 
深い青、豊かな青、緑、黄色、赤......いくつもの色が互いに変化し、混じり合っていました。 
不吉な霧のようなものが全体を包んでいて、輪郭がはっきりしないので、私たちの会話は非常に興奮したものになった。 
この時、私は一定に覚えているように、二人は事実上同時に話していた。 
この物体は何だと思うか、メモを取り合いながら。 
その物体は、高速道路の脇から100フィート（約15メートル）ほど上空を通過し、着陸した。 
それは埃を巻き上げているようで、あるいはもっと霧か何かに囲まれているようだった。 
霧か霞のような、白く濁った渦のようなものに囲まれているように見えました。 
その物体は、私の知る限り、合理的に説明できないものだと思いました。 
そして、ufoのトピックを研究することに何年も費やして、私は最終的にそれが明らかであるように思えました。 
本物のufoを見て、私が思っていたのとは違って、私の反応は、彼らが存在するイェイホーライの1つであるだろうと思いました。 
私は、これが、私の心を読んでいるだけでなく、その時に私に見えた何かであることを恐ろしく感じました。 
そして、私についてすべてを知っていましたが、私はそれに対して虫より多くなかったです 多分、興味深いタイプの虫<br>でも、これは私の認識で、その物体は宇宙船ではなく、ほとんど宇宙船に近いものでした。 
宇宙船ではなく、それ自体が一つの存在であるかのように思えました。 
この物体を観察し続け、その着陸時の残りを描いたとき、私の反応は、「この物体から離れろ」だった。 
この物から離れようということだった。私はいつも、これは非常に興味深いものだと考えていた。 
何十万人ものアメリカ人、そして世界中の人々を困惑させてきた興味深いもので、私は実際に見る機会に恵まれました。 
そんなものではありませんでした。それは奇妙で恐ろしい明るい物体で、怖かったです。 
私がufo効果について読んだものと同じであるので、私はできるだけ速くそれから離れたいと思いました。 
それはむしろ有害な効果であるように見えます 何人かの人々は燃やされ、影響されました<br>ufoの存在によって否定的に影響されたので、私の応答は私が逃げたと言ったようにありました あー キースはどれくらいよくわかりません<br>キースはこのものがどれくらい大きいかよくわかりません 彼が言うようにそれは言いにくいです なぜなら物体の遠近法が変わりました<br>霧の中の光は非常に紛らわしい効果を作り続けましたが、私は作らなければなりませんでした。 
大雑把に推測すると、横50フィート、幅50フィートくらいでしょうか。 
円形で、にじみ出るように変化し、変幻自在で、とても不穏な光景でした。 
脳がヘリコプターや飛行機のようなものを押し付けようとするからです。 
ヘリコプターや飛行機など、説明のつくものを押し付けようとしましたが、説明はつきませんでした。 
全く説明のつかない物体がここにあったのです。邪魔なもの、つまり悩ましいもの、人を悩ませるもの。
この時、彼らはかなり恐怖を感じ、そして<br>完全に魅了され、この物体を見ていました。この時、彼らは明らかに時間を失っていたのです。
キースが言ったように、次に覚えているのは、彼が彼の友人が運転していたことです。 
とても奇妙な現象が起こり始めました。お互いに英語で話すのではなく、<br>異言で話し始めたのです。 
それはとても不思議な体験で、その時は正しいことのように思えたのですが、同時に<br>しかし、脳の一部ではこの現象を観察し、一体何をしているのだろう？ 
そのあと10分か15分くらいは、その効果が徐々に消えていくような感じで<br>私たちはしびれを切らして、私の住むサンフランシスコ湾に車を走らせた。
家に帰ってもしばらくはその話はせず、1年後くらいにやっとその話をしました。 
一年後にようやくその話をしたのですが、その時にまた奇妙なことが起こりました。 
キースが言うように、非常に興味深いことが起こりました。 
私はそのことをすっかり忘れていました。 
奇妙なことですが、このようなことを研究していると、時間の欠落などがあることに気づきます。 
しかし、この時点では、友人が運転していて、私が運転していないことに突然気がついたこと以外は覚えていないのです。 
私は運転が大好きで、いつも運転しているのですが、その運転にとても執着しているのです。 
そして、彼はその物体からビームが出て、野原を横切って私たちの方へ流れてきたと言いました。 
その話を聞いたとき、私は恐ろしいほどそのことを覚えています。 
キースと彼の友人はその時、意識を失いました。 
キースも友人も意識を失いましたこの時、行方不明になっていたのです<br>キースはフラッシュバックを起こしながら<br>&quot;私が運転していたのに 彼が運転していたのはおかしい&quot; &quot;うまく説明できないが<br>車を停めて走り回ったような記憶があるような気がします<br>覚えていない 私たち二人はその光景にとても動揺していた
この出会いの後......キースは非常に強い反応を示し......彼を縛り付け......変えた<br>彼の人生は大きく変わりました彼は仕事を辞め<br>恋人と別れ、ずっとやりたかった職業に就くために学校に通うようになりました。 
ラジオ局のディスクジョッキーになったのです。 
最初は怖かったけれど、最終的には有益なことだったと思います。 
そして、キースが言うように、そして、私がこれを引用するとき、1つがこれらの物事ufo遭遇をしばしば研究するとき、珍しくないように思われるもう一つのことは人の生命を変えます<br>私の場合、それはより良いものでしたので、実際にどんな効果もあったかどうか私は証明することができませんが、私はオブジェクトの間にある種の相互作用があったことを疑います。 
この時点では、その出会いは有益だったように思います。 
しかし、もう覚えていないほど、大きな恐怖を感じていたのを覚えています。 
追い詰められた動物が、理解できない優れた力から逃げ出そうとするような。
キースは催眠術を考えましたが、彼が言うように、私はそれについて考えたことがありますが、私は催眠術師を知りません。 
催眠術をかける方法がわからないから、お金を払うのは気が進まない。 
催眠術の効果って信用できないから、誰か知り合いのお勧めの人がいれば<br>けど、これ以上いじくりまわしたくないんだ。 
実を言うと、もっと何かあるような気がして、それを知りたくないのです。 
時間を失った多くの人たちから聞いた反応です。彼らは事態を悪化させることを恐れています。 
その出会いが善意であったかのように感じ、何を発見するか恐れるのです それはキースの場合、確かにそうです しかし、彼の友人はずっと前から、このことを考えないようにしていました<br>この事を考えないようにしています。キースは言います。「たまに、友人と一緒になって、お互いを見て、<br>「あれは何だったんだろう」と言い合うと、話題が変わってしまうのです
キースはハワイに移住して、洞窟に住み、食料を備蓄していると聞いたことがあります。 
食料を蓄え、終末の時に備えていたそうです。彼は多くのコンタクティと同じように<br>地球が大きな環境災害に見舞われると信じています<br>人々は食料と水を備蓄する必要があり、広範囲に渡って生命が失われる可能性があると。 
このような話をよく聞きますので、キースがこのような反応をしていると聞いても、実はそれほど驚きませんでした。 
キースはこのような反応を しています たとえ何が起こったか 覚えていなくても<br>この行方不明の間に彼が船に乗せられたと思われる時、彼の反応は、環境災害の警告を受けたことと関係があるのではないかと思います。 
環境災害の警告を受けたということです。 <p></p>

<li><p>この UFO の正体は過去記事で取り上げたコレ↓だろう。</p>

<li><p>紐状に絡み合った orb 群がきつく折り畳まれて、地上付近にまで降りてきたもの。現場の強い EMF 異常によってこのような orb 群が発生した。その EMF 異常に晒されて、このふたりの目撃者は意識障害を引き起こした。それによって一時的に脳の発話機能も異常をきたし、海馬の記憶障害が missing-time として感じられた。</p>

0:00
hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and welcome to another episode of ufos on   the paranormal i call this episode three cases  of missing time i wanted to do this video because  
0:13
i think missing time is far more common than  people realize people will have what appears to  
0:19
be a simple sighting and it&apos;s not until much later  that they realize they had missing time and what i  
0:26
have come to discover is that when someone has a  close up sighting within a couple of hundred feet  
0:33
your chances of actually having missing time or  deeper levels of contact go way way up missing  
0:41
time is of course the number one indication that  you&apos;ve had an on board ufo encounter and yet it  
0:49
can slip by very easily unnoticed so that&apos;s why i  wanted to do this video and i&apos;ve got three cases  
0:56
for you i&apos;d like to present that i don&apos;t think  you&apos;ve heard before so let&apos;s just get started  
1:02
and the first case i want to talk about  i call missing time on grandview drive  
1:09
this occurred in 1961 which is actually  the same year as the betty and barney  
1:15
hill case at that time missing time  in association with ufo encounters  
1:22
was pretty much unheard of we certainly  didn&apos;t recognize what it meant at that time  
1:30
so that&apos;s significant i think in this case  this occurred on grandview drive in topanga  
1:37
canyon in southern california which is a major ufo  hot spot there were three witnesses beverly smith  
1:47
and her two young children there was lisa age  seven and kim age five they lived on observation  
1:58
drive which is located pretty high up  in elevation in the center of the canyon  
2:05
and one afternoon they decided that they were  going to drive down to the local fernwood market  
2:12
this is just a 20 minute drive from where they  live so they drove down from their home through  
2:20
the canyon and visited fernwood market bought a  few items and were heading back up to their home  
2:29
and some point on their way home they saw  something very strange what appeared to be  
2:38
silver disks hovering not too far away maybe  a quarter mile low in the sky in the canyon  
2:46
all three of them saw them and they  decided to pull over and take a closer look  
2:54
and they pulled over at the intersection  of observation drive and grand view  
3:02
and uh take took a closer look at these  strange discs that were hovering in the sky  
3:10
beverly saw them first uh she remembers there  being two discs and as she says i saw these two  
3:21
what we referred to then is flying saucers  or whatever outer space things it&apos;s over  
3:28
near where the park is i saw these  two things it was right there   and so all of a sudden they came together and  one just kind of sat down and stopped you could  
3:38
see them really clearly and it was just really  strange they were round like the pictures you  
3:44
see these days round similar to those tops  that you push and spin the old-fashioned  
3:49
spinning tops the cone was on the top  and they seemed flat on the bottom  
3:56
according to beverly these were bright  silver and glinted brightly in the afternoon  
4:02
sun she did not see any lights nor did she hear  any noise but her young daughter seven-year-old  
4:09
lisa also remembers this event clearly according  to lisa&apos;s memory there were actually three discs  
4:17
and she&apos;s pretty sure about this because she  remembers they were hovering in a triangular   formation as lisa says and i quote we saw these  three objects in the sky and to me i remember  
4:30
them being kind of multi-colored and soft they  weren&apos;t hard shaped things they didn&apos;t really  
4:36
have distinct edges they were saucer shaped but  they looked diffused at the edges and i remember  
4:43
them being kind of multi-colored kind of pastel  as opposed to primary colors i don&apos;t remember them  
4:51
moving kind of like moving but just hovering each  in place they definitely appeared solid but their  
4:58
edges and lights and colors were just diffused  almost like a fog was around them or something  
5:06
kim also remembers this event even though she  was only five years old at the time she doesn&apos;t  
5:13
have quite as much detail as the other two but she  does remember at least one of these discs hovering  
5:19
and glaring brightly in the sunlight as kim says  and i quote we looked over on the mountain there  
5:27
and on top of the mountain was a flying saucer and  it was silver and just hovering over this mountain  
5:33
we all got out and looked at it we were like wow  look at this flying saucer i felt no fear no fear  
5:40
at all we were just totally amazed we just stood  there got out of the car stopped stood there and  
5:47
looked at it it seemed close it didn&apos;t seem high  in the sky and far away it seemed close enough to  
5:54
see the details that it was a silver disc type  thing like the old type disc silvery round that  
6:03
is what i remember so the three witnesses stood  there for at least 5 10 maybe 15 minutes just  
6:12
watching these things they were very beautiful all  of them were very much impressed and at some point  
6:22
something weird happened they apparently  had missing time as beverly says and i quote  
6:30
the discs just kind of came together and i  can&apos;t say that they landed they just kind  
6:36
of settled there and all of a sudden they  just came apart and went off separate ways  
6:42
one went one way and the other went the  other way at this point they decided they  
6:48
were going to run home and get a camera  and binoculars and see if they could  
6:54
see these things more closely because one of them  was apparently still there and as beverly says  
7:01
it was so strange because i said well let&apos;s run  home let&apos;s get in the bus and get home real quick  
7:06
and get the binoculars and look at them real good  see what&apos;s going on so what was so strange that  
7:13
we we got in the bus i guess came home but none of  us remember coming home and we didn&apos;t think about  
7:20
it until the next day i don&apos;t know what time  we got home or anything it was really strange  
7:26
so i just said oh we won&apos;t say anything about  this because everybody will think we&apos;re crazy
7:35
kim also remembers this weird missing time aspect  as kim says and remember kim is the five-year-old  
7:45
we were going to get a camera in binoculars  and come back to look at it but we forgot  
7:51
about it until the next day and when we went  home we didn&apos;t remember it was broad daylight  
7:57
and then that was it it&apos;s lisa who  actually has a little bit more recall  
8:04
than the other two of what happened  following the sighting as lisa says  
8:10
i just remember standing there and looking  at them and as i was looking at them my mom&apos;s   saying let&apos;s go get the binoculars i remember  feeling like i didn&apos;t want to leave you know  
8:21
how you feel like you might miss something if  you leave i don&apos;t remember getting into the car  
8:27
we went home to get the binoculars but  we didn&apos;t remember to get the binoculars  
8:32
i do remember somebody saying we had been gone  an awful long time just to go to the store  
8:39
and we couldn&apos;t figure out why nobody remembered  about the binoculars until the next day  
8:45
we didn&apos;t remember why we had gone home i  just remember somebody saying we had been gone  
8:51
two or three hours i wouldn&apos;t  say i remember coming home   i remember being home i would put it  that way do i remember the drive home  
9:00
no i remember the drive down the hill standing  at that place and looking at these three objects  
9:07
it seemed to me there was a fight about  how long we were gone between my parents  
9:14
so it is clear that these three witnesses  did in fact have missing time but they don&apos;t  
9:23
don&apos;t understand what happened to the time  and again back in those days there was no  
9:31
correlation between missing time in onboard  ufo encounters so they didn&apos;t even consider  
9:37
that possibility until years later but  currently they do know that missing time is  
9:47
a good indication that there was an  onboard ufo experience but none of them  
9:54
really have any desire to go under hypnosis  beverly the mother doesn&apos;t talk about it much  
10:02
but her kids who are now adults uh still remember  it quite vividly and have considered hypnosis as  
10:11
lisa who was seven years old at the time says for  a time i was interested in having maybe regressive  
10:18
hypnosis or something to see if anything happened  to me but since i didn&apos;t have any recurring dreams  
10:24
or apparent losses of time except for that time  i just decided that it wasn&apos;t worth going into  
10:32
mostly because i have a sense of well-being and a  good feeling about it and since it feels that way  
10:39
since the reading i&apos;ve done indicates that  some people have pretty traumatic experiences  
10:44
and that sense of well-being is put there to  protect you i think i&apos;d like to leave it that way  
10:52
uh kim pretty much feels the same  way she&apos;s never really seriously   considered hypnosis and she doesn&apos;t really  talk about it too much either as kim says  
11:03
it&apos;s not something i&apos;ve told anybody about  because nobody believes you it&apos;s not something  
11:09
you go around and brag about it was just  something that we all saw and i&apos;ll never forget
11:18
so they kept it secret they told no one except  friends and family and it wasn&apos;t until there  
11:24
was a huge wave of sightings in that area to  panga canyon that they decided to go public  
11:31
they called the local topanga kenyan newspaper  the messenger and that&apos;s how they were put in  
11:38
touch with me and they agreed to be interviewed  it&apos;s a very interesting case of missing time  
11:46
i&apos;m pretty confident that they were  probably taken on board but hard to say  
11:55
they have no dreams they have no mysterious  scars on their body that they can relate directly  
12:01
to this but the fact that all three of them have  had missing time indicates to me that yeah they  
12:08
probably had an onboard encounter and now we move  to the second case the second case i call missing  
12:18
time in malibu and this occurred actually not too  far away from the previous case malibu is right  
12:26
next to topanga canyon and the main witnesses  in this case are robert and his wife who owned a  
12:37
home in malibu canyon right off malibu canyon on a  little road called payuma it was actually a street  
12:45
right off of payuma a dead-end street this is a  very rural area quite a few homes there but it&apos;s  
12:54
surrounded by wilderness and again this is  a very active area when it comes to ufos  
13:03
and roberts had robert had always been interested  in ufos but his encounters began around 1975  
13:12
when he began meditating and one evening in  1975 he decided to sit down and meditate and  
13:21
concentrate on calling down a ufo he wanted to  see one so he sat down and meditated and imagined  
13:30
bringing down a ufo and to his shock it worked  like a a charm he says following his meditation  
13:39
he saw quote a brilliant orange globe of  light floating lazily towards the ocean  
13:47
so this apparently opened the door to a number  of other encounters because he started having  
13:53
sightings fairly regularly after this in fact it  was two months later he saw quote a brilliant red  
14:01
ball of light it zoomed overhead at about 200  miles per hour he estimates it was moving very  
14:09
fast and he saw it for maybe 10 11 seconds  before it uh disappeared off in the distance  
14:18
but it was just a short time later that he had  another sighting in 1977 it was two years later  
14:26
he saw quote a yellow orange sphere again it  was in the same area over his home in pyuma  
14:35
and this object was at very low altitude low  enough where he lost a view of it behind some  
14:42
trees was a very brief sighting just a few seconds  but he&apos;s absolutely convinced it was unexplained  
14:50
so he had three sightings over a space of  about two years and this was when the ufos  
14:57
came much closer and he apparently had missing  time or a ufo landing involving missing time  
15:06
this occurred in october of 1978 robert  had retired to his bedroom to lay down  
15:14
this was during the afternoon and he was alone  in the house just laying in bed his bedroom has  
15:21
a glass door which overlooks the backyard  at any rate he was laying down in his bed  
15:30
just dozing and relaxing when  suddenly something strange happened  
15:36
he heard and felt a very strong and intense low  vibration and as robert says and i quote i was  
15:49
completely paralyzed and could not even  open my eyes until the vibration stopped  
15:56
he&apos;s not really sure how long this went on  so there was a period of disorientation there  
16:04
that&apos;s definitely a red flag pointing towards  missing time but at any rate at some point it  
16:10
did stop and he immediately jumped up and went all  through the house looking for any indication of  
16:19
something strange and found nothing and uh he was  pretty sure it wasn&apos;t a dream or anything because  
16:27
it seemed so real and it was a short time later  two days later actually that he got proof or at  
16:34
least evidence that something very strange had  happened because he went out into his backyard  
16:42
and saw something that really shocked  him you saw quote a lush vibrant green  
16:49
17 foot diameter ring of grass about 8  inches wide this was directly outside his  
16:59
glass sliding door outside of his bedroom and as  he examined the area he saw something else which  
17:05
puzzled him the tip of a 30 foot tall pine tree  which grew alongside his yard had been broken  
17:14
it was cracked and hanging down so this  was a pretty good indication to him that  
17:21
something bizarre had happened and uh putting  all the pieces together this vibrational noise  
17:29
his being paralyzed the cracked pine tree  the ring of grass it looked to him like a  
17:36
very large 17 foot wide object had come down  and hovered over his backyard or perhaps even  
17:45
landed there and this mysterious ring remained  visible it slowly faded as the months went by  
17:56
but after a year it was still faintly visible and  then the same thing happened again it was now 1979  
18:05
and robert was again resting in bed when he had  a strong impression that someone or something  
18:12
was standing outside his bedroom door out  in the backyard and he was about to get up  
18:21
but didn&apos;t as he says i intended to get up and  investigate then woke up sometime later and  
18:28
thought nothing more of it until later that week  when a second lush vibrant green 17 foot diameter  
18:36
ring of grass appeared on my back lawn right next  to the first one which was still there at this  
18:44
point he became absolutely convinced that this was  a ufo and he had probably had missing time again  
18:52
he saw no marks on his body had no dreams he has  not elected to go under hypnosis but it certainly  
19:01
made him realize that he has probably been  taken onboard a craft he&apos;s probably a contactee  
19:09
and his sightings continued it was two years later  in 1982 he had his fourth ufo sighting of a red  
19:15
light that moved overhead he saw it the next night  and the next night after that three days in a row  
19:24
but then it never returned but it was two months  later he had what he counts as his eighth sighting  
19:32
so when someone has eight sightings i mean this  is another huge indicator that they&apos;re a contact d  
19:39
uh he was outside looked overhead and was watching  a jet go overhead heading towards lax which is not  
19:49
terribly far from his home he knows the flight  paths very well and was just watching it go  
19:55
overhead when this weird green light sped up  behind the jet and actually overtook it and zoomed  
20:03
off into the distance he estimates this object  was moving at about three times the speed of  
20:10
the jet so that&apos;s many many hundreds of miles per  hour perhaps up to a thousand miles per hour very  
20:18
fast and like all of his sightings this object was  completely silent at least as far as he could tell  
20:27
at this point the sightings seemed to stop  robert and his wife went on with their lives but  
20:34
10 years later on may 12 1992 robert had a sudden  impulse to try to meditate and call down a ufo  
20:44
so he and his wife did it together they  meditated together on seeing a ufo and it  
20:49
worked it worked like a charm as robert says and  i quote we both observed a brilliant incandescent  
20:57
white sphere suddenly appear while descending at  a very rapid rate from five to from about seven  
21:05
to five thousand feet it appeared below a ridge  line without slowing down with super fast and  
21:13
again totally silent what&apos;s really interesting  about this sighting which occurred on may 12th  
21:19
1992 was almost exactly one month later on june  14th 1992 when there was a huge wave of sightings  
21:29
involving hundreds of objects seen by scores of  people all throughout the santa monica mountains  
21:36
and this was the beginning of a massive ufo wave  which swept through this area and lasted for  
21:43
well over two years unfortunately at this  point due to financial considerations  
21:51
robert and his wife moved out of malibu and up to  oregon and their encounters pretty much stopped  
21:59
so that&apos;s that case it&apos;s a very interesting case  involving missing time and once again the witness  
22:06
has no real memory of being on board a ufo but  it&apos;s pretty clear at least to me that that&apos;s  
22:14
what in fact happened and now i want to talk  about the third case which i think is the most  
22:21
dramatic case and i call this case missing time  on highway five the main witness is keith boyer  
22:31
that it is a pseudonym uh and he had a  friend along with him they were driving  
22:39
from los angeles to san francisco along highway  5 in 1982 and they were about half way between  
22:50
la and san francisco in the middle of the  central valley sort of near the fresno area  
22:57
and uh it was late at night around 2 a.m  there was very little traffic on the road  
23:04
they were moving at about a good clip of about  70 miles per hour when looking ahead of them  
23:12
they saw something very strange on the road it was  a bright bright multi-colored object surrounded by  
23:21
this weird foggy mist now keith had always been  interested in ufos he&apos;s read a number of books so  
23:30
he was super excited and he gave a very really  really good description about what he saw so i  
23:37
just like to quote keith extensively and let him  describe in his own words what happened as he says  
23:48
i was driving through the central valley on  interstate 5 and i was approximately halfway   between san francisco and l.a i was with a good  friend who is a very hard-headed individual  
23:59
a firm pillar of the community type not given to  hysteria or anything and i probably wouldn&apos;t tell  
24:07
you the story and wouldn&apos;t even be thinking  about it a whole lot anymore if this guy   hadn&apos;t been with me but we were driving down the  road and sure enough there was something strange  
24:18
hovering on the horizon as we were driving towards  it it appeared to be some kind of flashing light  
24:24
something that was hovering over the freeway well  we drove along towards it and you know everyone  
24:31
drives through the central valley at 70 miles per  hour there wasn&apos;t a car behind us and not much  
24:37
traffic on the road at all really it was 2 a.m  and so the object was pretty indescribable from  
24:44
a distance the colors and lights seemed rather  striking and the conversation turned to what is  
24:52
that well it might be a plane flying along and  maybe it&apos;s a police patrol or something no it&apos;s  
24:59
pretty bright well maybe it&apos;s a crop duster plane  so as this conversation progresses we&apos;re heading  
25:06
directly towards this object which apparently is  a hundred feet off the ground above the freeway  
25:12
on our side of the freeway and as we got  closer to it more and more details became clear  
25:20
the object was a series of lights seemingly  merging and rotating into each other  
25:26
with a kind of indefinable mist surrounding  the object a fuzzy atmospheric phenomenon  
25:33
at this point the conversation between my friend  and i became extremely animated and it was like  
25:41
well maybe it&apos;s a crop dusting helicopter no that  theory was rejected because there aren&apos;t any crop  
25:48
dusting helicopters that i&apos;ve ever heard of so  we&apos;re continuing to drive over towards this object  
25:54
which is now beginning to move over to the  right of the freeway but it is also descending
26:02
at this point keith and his friend hadn&apos;t felt  any fear they were just pretty excited about it  
26:11
keith always likes to drive by the way he will not  get into a car unless he is driving this fact will  
26:18
become important later but i&apos;ll just let keith  continue describing what happened as keith says as  
26:26
we continued to zoom towards this object the light  became almost uncomfortably bright very odd colors  
26:35
deep rich blues greens yellows reds a number  of them shifting and merging into each other  
26:45
and this ominous looking fog or  mist surrounded the whole thing   it was hard to make out an outline of anything  so our conversation became extremely agitated  
26:56
at this point as i remember constant you  know both talking virtually at the same time  
27:02
comparing notes about what we thought this thing  was and as the object descended and as we began  
27:09
to draw abreast of it it was maybe a hundred feet  over the side of the freeway and landing and it  
27:15
seemed to be kicking up dust or maybe it was more  fog or whatever the object seems surrounded by  
27:21
fog or haze a hazy mist kind of cloudy white kind  of swirling tendrils of stuff so at this point i  
27:30
perceived that the object was unlike anything i  could possibly explain rationally with what i know  
27:37
and having spent years studying the topic of  ufos it seemed clear to me that i was finally  
27:43
seeing a genuine ufo and unlike what i thought my  reaction would be one of they do exist yay hooray  
27:52
i felt horror this was something that seemed to  me at the time that was not only reading my mind  
27:59
and knew everything about me but i was no more  than a bug to it maybe an interesting type of bug  
28:06
but this is my perception of what the object  was it seemed to me that the object wasn&apos;t a  
28:12
spaceship is almost something that was an entity  into itself unto itself so my friend and i are  
28:19
continuing to observe this object and as we draw  a rest of it in its landing my reaction was to  
28:25
get the hell away from this thing i always  thought my reaction would be here is a very  
28:31
interesting thing that has befuddled hundreds  of thousands of americans and people all over   the world and i&apos;m actually privileged to see one  let&apos;s stop the car walk over and knock on the door  
28:43
it was nothing like that it was an odd and  terrifying bright object that was scary and  
28:50
i wanted to get away from it as fast as possible  because with what i had read of ufo effects is  
28:57
there does seem to be a rather harmful effect some  people have been burned and have been affected  
29:02
negatively by ufo presences so my response was as  i said to get away uh keith is not quite sure how  
29:14
big this thing was as he says it&apos;s hard to  tell because the perspective of the object  
29:20
kept shifting and the light in the mist made  for a very confusing effect but i had to make  
29:27
if i had to make a very rough ballpark guess  i&apos;d say maybe 50 feet across and 50 feet wide  
29:33
roughly circular but oozing changing  transmogrifying it was a profoundly disturbing  
29:41
sight because it could not be explained by the  brain the brain kept trying to impose things like  
29:46
helicopters or airplanes as explanations but there  were no explanations and that was when the shock  
29:54
began here was a completely inexplicable object  disturbing i mean distressing it bothers one
30:06
so they were pretty uh fearful at this time and uh  
30:13
just totally entranced and watching this object  and this is when they apparently had missing time
30:26
because as keith says the next thing i remember  he his friend was driving and at that point  
30:36
a very strange phenomenon began happening  instead of speaking to each other in english  
30:43
we began babbling speaking  in tongues it&apos;s been called  
30:48
and it was a profoundly disturbing experience  it seemed right at the time but there was also  
30:55
a part of the brain that was observing  all of this and going well what the hell  
31:01
are you doing so that continued for about  10 or 15 minutes afterwards the effect  
31:08
seemed to slowly wear off and we numbly continued  our drive into the san francisco bay where i lived
31:19
so after returning home they did not discuss it  not not for some time and it was about a year  
31:26
later that they finally uh mentioned it to each  other and this is when another very strange thing  
31:34
happened as uh keith says and i quote now we  get to a very interesting thing my friend told  
31:43
me about a year later about a beam that had come  out of the object and i had forgotten all about  
31:50
it which is odd but as one studies these things  one finds that there is missing time and so forth  
31:57
but at this point i don&apos;t remember any more than  suddenly realizing that my friend was driving and  
32:03
i wasn&apos;t which is odd because i&apos;m a very obsessive  driver who loves to drive and always drives  
32:11
and he described this beam that came out of the  object and swept across the field towards us  
32:18
well when he said that i had a horrible memory  of it i remember neither of us wanted to get  
32:24
hit by that beam but it hit us at that point both  keith and his friend blacked out when this being  
32:33
struck their car this is when they actually  had missing time uh and neither of them  
32:40
really remember what happened during this missing  time though keith did have a few flashbacks as he  
32:47
says it was funny i was driving and then suddenly  he was driving i can&apos;t explain that not very well  
32:55
i seem to i don&apos;t know do i have memories  of stopping the car and shuffling around  
33:02
i don&apos;t remember we were very upset both of  us were very upset by the sight of the thing
33:11
so following this encounter uh keith did have  a very strong reaction it chained him changed  
33:20
him profoundly and in fact it completely  altered the path of his life he quit his job  
33:30
he left his girlfriend he ended up going to school  to pursue the profession he always wanted to do  
33:36
which was being a disc jockey on a radio station  and he feels that this encounter although scary  
33:43
at first was ultimately beneficial because it  really led to a huge spiritual awakening for him  
33:50
and as keith says and i quote this  is another thing that seems not   uncommon when one studies these things ufo  encounters often change a person&apos;s life  
34:01
in my case it was for the better  so whether there was actually any   effect i can&apos;t prove but i suspect that there was  some kind of an interaction between the object  
34:12
and myself and my friend and certainly at this  point i feel like the encounter was beneficial  
34:18
but i remember feeling great horror and fear up  to the point that i don&apos;t remember anymore like  
34:24
an animal that was trapped and wanted to get away  from a superior force that was incomprehensible
34:33
keith did consider hypnosis but as he says i&apos;ve  thought about it but i don&apos;t know any hypnotist  
34:40
i can trust i really am reluctant to pay some  hypnosis i don&apos;t know how to hypnotize me the  
34:48
whole effect of hypnosis to me i don&apos;t trust it  so if there was someone i knew someone recommended  
34:55
who was good who could be vouched for but right  now i&apos;m reluctant to tamper with it any further  
35:02
to tell you the truth i have a horrible  feeling that there was more to it   and i really would like not to know about it  so this is an effect a reaction that i&apos;ve heard  
35:14
from many other people who have missing time  they&apos;re afraid of opening up a can of worms  
35:20
they feel like their encounter was benevolent  and they&apos;re scared of what they might   uncover that&apos;s certainly true in keith&apos;s case his  friend however has gone much farther to try to  
35:35
not think about this as keith says every once  in a while my friends and i get together and  
35:42
we&apos;ll look at each other and say what  was that thing and the topic will change
35:50
last i heard keith actually ended up moving to  hawaii and was living in a cave and stocking up  
36:01
food and preparing for quote the end times  he really believes like many contactees  
36:11
that our earth is coming up for some  major major environmental disasters  
36:18
and uh that people need to stock up food and water  and there could very well be widespread loss of  
36:25
life i hear this quite often so i wasn&apos;t actually  that surprised when i heard that this is how keith  
36:33
is has reacted to all of this so even though  he doesn&apos;t remember what actually happened  
36:42
when he during this missing time  when he was presumably taken on board   i suspect his reactions has something to  do with this that he was given warnings  
36:52
of environmental disaster because that is  the number one message i hear from people  
36:58
so those are the three cases that i wanted to  present involving missing time and again the  
37:04
reason i wanted to do this is because i want  people to realize that if you have a close-up  
37:10
sighting within a couple of hundred feet it&apos;s  really quite possible that this is more than just  
37:16
a simple sighting and that you have had missing  time and were possibly taken on board and yeah  
37:26
again this is much more common than people  realize i heard a quote from j allen heineck  
37:31
that one in 40 people have been taken on board and  i think that&apos;s probably pretty close to accurate  
37:42
that&apos;s what really got me into asking everyone i  knew have you had an encounter and i didn&apos;t have  
37:48
to ask 40 people and i found about five people  who have had this missing time including keith  
37:57
and it was a year later when the roper poll the  roper organization found that one in 50 people  
38:02
have had an onboard ufo encounter so i do think  this is much more common than people realize and  
38:09
that&apos;s really why i wanted to do this video  because this is something this phenomena of  
38:15
missing time and being taken on board i think is  fairly widespread and people should know about it  
38:23
so that&apos;s it for today i hope you&apos;ve enjoyed  this episode i really appreciate you watching  
38:29
thanks very much hope you&apos;re having a great  day and until next time keep having fun
