<ul>
<li>There is a famous UFO photo (below) that was officially recognized by the Brazilian government.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/20220714_brzl2.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traditionally, the size of this UFO has been estimated to be over 15 meters in diameter. The Brazilian government estimated this size based on eyewitness testimony that the UFO went around the backside of a distant mountain and then emerged from the backside of that mountain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have determined that this UFO is a small spinning orb located close to where the photo was taken. Why did the witnesses in this photo misidentify a small orb at close range as a giant-sized UFO? </p>
</li>
<li><p>The key to solving this mystery is the specific case discussed below.</p>

<h3 id="the-part-about-the-subject">The part about the subject</h3>
- 51:40 Jimmy Church own experience. Broad daylight. Sighted for 10-15 sec. at the base of Mt. Adams (*: James Gilliland&apos;s ECETI site) through a telescope. Also visible to naked eye. It was about the size of a crude oil tanker.

- The estimated UFO looked like a 400ft tall beer can, emerging from the backside of the summit 14 miles away. It looked like a black cylinder spinning vertically (as shown in the photo below, a paper cup of coffee is used to illustrate the scene as if it were the UFO).

<a href="../img/20220518_jc.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220518_jc.jpg" border="0" height="496" src="../img/20220518_jc.jpg" width="581"></a>


- A silver circle was painted on one side, which became visible as it rotated. The top and bottom edges were chrome. Sunlight was illuminating it.

- About 30 people witnessed it together. I could not photograph it because it disappeared while I was looking for my camera.

- 57:45 (Play audio recording of the scene at this time. Steve Murillo (former Navy pilot), who was standing next to me, said the UFO was shimmering.

<h3 id="my-view">My view</h3>
- Guest John Michael Godier (below: science fiction author and science commentator) attempts a scientific explanation of Jimmy Church&apos;s testimony (omitted).

<a href="../img/20220518_JMG.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220518_JMG.jpg" border="0" height="390" src="../img/20220518_JMG.jpg" width="606"></a>


- I interpret this UFO as follows.

- There are many fault zones (*1) near Mt. Adams. The orb appears luminous at night, but during the day it appears silver, gray, or black, depending on the energy of the orb.

- Jimmy Church estimated the UFO to be 400 ft. high because it emerged from behind the summit of Mt. Adams. However, this UFO did not emerge from behind the summit, but an ordinary orb should have appeared in the air not far from Jimmy Church&apos;s point.

- Because orb is a thin plasma, not a solid, it is visible as black or gray against a sky or cloud background, but almost invisible against a mountain background in broad daylight. In other words, an orb at most a few hundred meters away appeared against a mountain background and rose slowly into the sky.

- The orb&apos;s background was not seen by Jimmy Church et al. until it reached the sky above the summit, which caused Jimmy Church et al. to believe that a giant UFO had appeared from behind the summit. This gave Jimmy Church et al. the illusion that a giant UFO had appeared from behind the summit of the mountain.

- The orb was rotating at a low speed, so the irregularity of the orb was probably seen as a silver circle on a black fuselage.

<li>I checked the video today and found that an audio transcription (auto-generated) had been added, so I am attaching the audio transcription (auto-generated) of the relevant part below. The audio recorded at the site at the time is also played back in this video. Jimmy Church states that no video was taken of the UFO in question, only a photo, but a quick look at the photo does not show it in the video above.</li>

<blockquote>
this is something i&apos;ve mentioned
51:28
many times on this show so i apologize to those that have heard
51:34
it before but those that haven&apos;t uh which includes you john i i don&apos;t know maybe you&apos;ve heard the story but um
51:41
i&apos;m up in in washington state and i&apos;ve got uh i&apos;m hosting uh my conference i&apos;ve
51:47
got about three 300 people there but outside i&apos;m taking a break and i&apos;m sitting at a picnic
51:54
table i&apos;ve got about 30 friends around me um we&apos;re goofing around i&apos;m sitting there
51:59
with binoculars on a tripod at this picnic table and i&apos;m looking at birds
52:05
i&apos;m literally looking at mount adams which is 14 miles away we know that
52:11
and i&apos;m looking at the birds i&apos;m looking at the peak of mount adams when at that moment
52:17
14 miles away from behind the peak of the mountain pops up this guesstimating
52:25
400 foot tall beer can and it&apos;s spinning like this and there
52:32
was a a a silver circle on one side you could
52:37
see it rotating it&apos;s black and it&apos;s got like a thick chrome top and a thick chrome bottom
52:43
and it&apos;s going across the canals what right and i freak out
52:49
and i look again in the binoculars i&apos;m like that is the biggest thing i&apos;ve ever seen in my life
52:55
and it&apos;s up you know and it&apos;s going it&apos;s in the middle of the day it&apos;s three o&apos;clock in the afternoon and the sun is
53:00
shining on it it&apos;s razor sharp in focus and i lose my mind
53:06
and uh i&apos;ll send you the video so i jump up and i&apos;m like man
53:12
video video i&apos;m losing it it&apos;s like five seconds later the whole event lasted
53:17
about 10 or 15 seconds i come back to the binocular everybody sees it and i look at it
53:23
with my naked eye and i could see the you know i could see it i could see it spinning and i could see the sunlight
53:28
and every time that circle came around it right it would light up and uh and it&apos;s gone i go back to the binoculars
53:35
and i take like one more i&apos;m trying to absorb it right into my brain what i&apos;m
53:41
seeing and i look at it from top to bottom and i come back out to look again and somebody says it&apos;s gone
53:48
it&apos;s like what i thought we were gonna see it for like an hour moving across the sky i said what do you mean it&apos;s
53:55
gone i go back to my it phased out man it phased out i go back to the it&apos;s gone
54:02
it&apos;s gone now i can&apos;t say that was alien
54:09
but i can tell you this that was the craziest thing and that was in the middle of the day this was in
54:15
that night this wasn&apos;t lights in the sky this was 400 feet tall
54:21
14 miles away from behind the mountain and i i am left with nothing that i want to
54:28
know what that was that&apos;s it somebody knows something that is uh uh
54:37
um when when you share that with 30 other people and we all see this together they
54:43
need those answers i need those answers but that wasn&apos;t that wasn&apos;t our military
54:50
---
JMG:
no well we we were handicapped by the problem that and curse melon brings us
54:55
up a lot in his articles that were handicapped by the government&apos;s unwillingness to
55:01
release data because whatever you saw there&apos;s probably a radar record if it was uh indeed solid
55:07
um but there&apos;s probably a radar record of that you know something that big you know that high if it&apos;s up as high as
55:13
mount adams it&apos;s it&apos;s pretty high um now i can tell you now and this don&apos;t
55:20
shoot the skeptic but atmospheric things the atmosphere can do weird things and create photo morganas and things like
55:26
that but maybe that&apos;s a little high for that if it was you know at that altitude above the atmosphere
55:32
because you know usually this stuff is is a phenomenon of being near the horizon
55:38
um so you know it wasn&apos;t a 
---
JC:
this wasn&apos;t a floating exxon oil tanker
55:44
---
JMG:
yeah well the other question is that if it was something that you didn&apos;t immediately recognize
55:50
what it was because if it was an oil tanker you know out in the ocean or something you&apos;d know that right but this
55:55
you don&apos;t know so 
---
JC:
i can&apos;t describe it any more than what i just said to you it was uh 14 miles away
56:03
it popped out from behind the mountain it didn&apos;t come in from the other side of the peak of the mountain i didn&apos;t see
56:09
any of that uh it and i was looking for probably 10 or 15 minutes there and i would have
56:14
seen it come in from somewhere else it just came in but this
56:21
no wings you know nothing you know nothing that would it it was crazy so now when
56:28
when i see something like that um and and i hear others say
56:34
it&apos;s your imagination or it&apos;s there&apos;s you it wasn&apos;t there or was it no no no
56:40
no no you&apos;re not going to change anything about what happened but you can&apos;t tell me that there&apos;s nothing going
56:46
on 
---
JMG:
did everyone did everyone present describe exactly the same object
56:46
on did everyone did everyone present describe exactly the same object
---
JC:
okay uh
56:52
you know what check this out check this out um i will play you
56:59
this is the video um i&apos;m just gonna play the audio and uh
57:05
let me let me pull it up here just just stay with me where is it
57:18
yeah you gotta love live radio right you gotta love live radio
57:25
and yeah and they got to avoid the dead era you know yeah i wasn&apos;t expecting uh to play this
57:33
um 
---
JMG:
well the reason i asked was that sometimes there&apos;s some theories floating
57:40
around about people that that 
---
JC:
okay here it is tell me somebody took a picture
57:46
i swear to god i will shoot everybody here i disappeared now oh no there it is
57:54
there it is i got it i got it i got it give us a position man [Music]
58:00
no the ufo wasn&apos;t a bird no that was shimmering that was snowing it was it was a ball it was huge
58:08
okay who shot it so uh that voice there that you hear in
that voice there that you hear in
58:14
the background that&apos;s steve morillo and you probably know steve um but
58:20
fighter pilot uh for the marines uh united states naval academy graduate he
58:25
was sitting next to me that was his comment it was it was it was shimmering it was round it was shimmering
58:33
