- Mike Clelland and Nick Redfern present a podcast in which they critique the ETH theory (UFOs are alien vehicles) based on a variety of testimonials.


<h3 id="excerpt">Excerpt</h3>
From 56:50.

A story about a woman in Canada (of Indian descent). A friend of hers passed away. She was performing a mourning ceremony (probably not related to a funeral and not involving the body) by beating a drum inside a Tipi (a conical tent used by the Indians), according to Indian tradition.

Then she noticed that someone was pushing on the fabric of the tent from the outside. Strangely, I went outside the tent and found five Bigfoots there.

In a panic, she went back inside the tent and continued to play the drums loudly. Hoping that the Bigfoot would leave at the sound. Eventually, Bigfoot and the others left.

Then she noticed that someone was pushing on the fabric of the tent from the outside. Strangely, he went outside the tent and found five Bigfoots.

She went back inside the tent and continued to beat the drums loudly. Hoping that the Bigfoot would leave at the sound. Eventually, Bigfoot (the family) left.

When Bigfoot left, she went back inside. Her children were making a big fuss. The child said he had seen Shadow People in the house and was very scared.

So she decided to inform her husband who was working in the garage (away from the house). As she was walking to the garage, she saw a huge triangular UFO hovering just above the trees right next to the garage (so low that it almost touched the tops of the trees).

She informed her husband, and he witnessed the UFO with her. The UFO was translucent like a holographic image.

<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
This case shows that Shamanism, Bigfoot, Shadow People, and UFOs are closely interrelated, and if true (which is probably the case since many other similar cases have been reported), the theory that UFOs are high-tech alien mecha will be greatly challenged. This is a shaky case study.

101:01
senses the shadow beings aren&apos;t like

members of all that&apos;s not something you
101:06
see in a haunted house and the Sasquatch
101:08
aren&apos;t big hairy apes that live in the
101:10
woods and the flying saucer or the
101:13
triangle UFOs aren&apos;t aren&apos;t a spaceship
101:18
from another planet this is all somehow
101:20
inner woven and this is out of sight on
101:23
our property where she has there are so
101:26
many beautiful owl stories I just could
101:28
only tell a few in the book but um so
101:31
this is what so here&apos;s a woman her she
101:34
loves owls she has this experiences and
101:36
she&apos;s also helping people she&apos;s doing a
101:38
lot of volunteer work helping people
101:39
using her psychic skills to you know if
101:43
it&apos;s to be believed the way she

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- As of 2020-11-29, there was no prospect of solving the mystery of this case. In other words, the case appeared to be so complex and bizarre as to be unmanageable due to the intertwining of the following elements.

　　- Shamanism
　　- Bigfoot
　　- Shadow People
　　- UFO (close-range encounter)

　The case seemed to be so complicated and bizarre that it was beyond our ability to handle it.

- However, in hindsight, the solution seems to be quite simple.

<h3 id="the-cause-of-this-series-of-puzzling-incidents">The cause of this series of puzzling incidents</h3>
- However, because of the &quot;EMF anomalies&quot;(*1) around the family (*2), the whole family suffered from temporary disorientation at the same time and only saw various hallucinations.

- In fact, there is no physical evidence of any kind; no photographs of the UFO were taken, no evidence of Bigfoot
No body hair or footprints were collected.

<h4 id="2">(*2)</h4>
- There are other possibilities besides EMF anomalies in this case. For example, it is possible that hallucinogenic mushrooms were accidentally mixed in with the family&apos;s food. However, since the same thing is true of consciousness disorders, I will use &quot;EMF abnormality&quot; as a representative example.
