<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- Ben Hansen has given the following reasons for the appearance of UFOs/UAPs at this site.

　　- The UFOs themselves may have chosen this area of magnetic anomalies to hide the EMFs they emit.

- This is a rather painful explanation.

29:43
it i thought he had a lot of interesting things to say and a whole new perspective
29:49
in particular bryce one of the things that he drew our attention to was quite interesting magnetic anomalies that
29:57
happen exactly in the area where the 2004 uss nimitz sighting occurred have a
30:04
listen to what ben told us well this whole channel that we&apos;re in from santa barbara to catalina and
30:10
including an island known as san clemente right off here on the back is really unique right because you have an
30:16
area of tectonic um anomalies you got a lot of fault lines going through here so this
30:22
but also big big lumps of land rubbing yeah plates clashing against each other and and geologists
30:28
don&apos;t even know how some of these things are formed you have here the catalina crater and what&apos;s called the emery knoll
30:34
right next to it now these two features lie right off the coast of a very very deep trench over
30:40
four or five thousand feet and along with this we have these magnetic anomalies
30:46
now look what&apos;s right off the back side of san clemente so this that&apos;s a huge catalina
30:52
yeah this gray color depicts the strongest practically the strongest magnetic intensity that you can have now
30:59
what does it mean that&apos;s what we&apos;re interested in because the the nimitz uh videos the sightings
31:06
of people that have been talking to me see things between the channel and the coast all the way up to santa barbara
31:13
all the way down here of objects entering the water so you don&apos;t think it&apos;s a coincidence that there&apos;s a huge magnetic anomaly
31:19
there no i there&apos;s a lot of theories now this sounds really strange right but
31:25
one theory is as we believe that some of these craft have a propulsion system that creates its own
31:31
magnetic uh field right sure so if you wanted to hide that if let&apos;s say set up
31:36
a base of operations where would be the perfect place to do it in a place that already has a natural feature
31:42
that can hide or cover up any signatures that you&apos;re putting out
31:49
one of the interesting things i thought going out with ben tatus is that it isn&apos;t just the government that gets to










- Ben Hansen taking UFO/UAP photos with his night vision camera.

<a href="../img/20220825_bh_anmjpg.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220825_bh_anmjpg.jpg" border="0" height="650" src="../img/20220825_bh_anmjpg.jpg" width="1078"></a>

33:06
take the fact that it&apos;s now possible for journalists like ben hansen to obtain
33:12
military-grade non-exportable night vision gear that allows you to see very
33:17
clearly at night it&apos;s quite extraordinary and one of the things i found quite fascinating is whilst we
33:23
didn&apos;t see any strange anomalous objects that night that we were out there with him
33:28
he told us that frequently he does we see a lot of things in in orbit and
33:34
suddenly they&apos;ll start changing directions doing s turns really um disappearing or
33:40
or reappearing you know so is there anything else is there anything of our technology in orbit that can do s turns
33:46
not at that altitude you consider that they&apos;re they&apos;re falling at about 17 500
33:51
miles an hour so if in real time you&apos;re turning that quickly
33:57
not only could the craft not survive the g-force but occupants couldn&apos;t unless you&apos;re using some sort of
34:05
inertia displacing you know propulsion

The world is watching as the US Congress looks into the UAP phenomenon. Here, veteran investigative journalists Ross Coulthart and Bryce Zabel break down the news, and speak with credible experts and insiders. Subscribe now » <a href="http://7news.link/SpotlightSubscribe" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://7news.link/SpotlightSubscribe" target="_blank">http://7news.link/SpotlightSubscribe</a>

This is a special edition of NEED TO KNOW in collaboration with Australia’s 7NEWS.

For those of you who aren’t already viewers or listeners to NEED TO KNOW @Need to Know (Coulthart &amp; Zabel)  presented by Ross Coulthart and his friend and colleague Bryce Zabel, NEED TO KNOW is a show that gives you the latest news and analysis about what they suspect will soon turn out to be the biggest story ever, the emerging astonishing revelations about UAPs – Unidentified Aerial Phenomena - what some folk have long called UFOs.

As you’ll see, Bryce and Ross think this is a story that needs to be taken very seriously after decades of what we both believe is unjustified stigma and ridicule. UAPs are an authentic mystery that can no longer be denied.

Ross and Bryce embarked on a road trip of the US, speaking with credible experts and insiders for this documentary.

Hear from Ryan Graves, the former US Navy advanced fighter pilot, whose testimony to Congressmen and Senator in closed door hearings in Congress has been key in waking politicians up to the reality that this phenomenon, whatever it is, is a potential national security threat and a real danger to flight safety.

Investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell shares insights on secrets he believes the US government is hiding.

Ross and Bryce also went UAP hunting with investigator Ben Hansen, in an area renowned for sightings.

Ross also sits down for an incredible interview with Professor Garry Nolan.
Garry is a Stanford University professor, an internationally renowned immunologist, who has recently been nominated for a Nobel Prize. He’s also been involved in secret work for the CIA investigating illnesses suffered by military and intelligence personnel who’ve had damaging close-up experiences with UAPs.

And Bryce&apos;s co-creator of TV series  &apos;Dark Skies&apos;, Brent Friedman, reveals a bizarre encounter he had, when the show was launched.

<h3 id="my-view">My view</h3>
- It is unlikely that Ben Hansen discovered this information on his own. In fact, there are many UFO researchers who have not mentioned this information, not even Steve Mera, who has long pursued the connection between UFO phenomena and magnetic anomalies.

- Ben Hansen calls himself a former FBI agent, but I have a suspicion that he is a UFO disinformation agent on the side of the FBI based on his words and actions. Therefore, I think that the title of this article is probably a leak of information from the FBI.


<h3 id="related-past-articles">Related Past Articles</h3>


<blockquote>
- Pilot Ryan Graves saw an orb. The orb looked to his eyes like a cube in a transparent sphere. Why? As I briefly mentioned in a previous article (Ben Hansen&apos;s information (= alibi leak from the FBI?)), the Navy was conducting a training exercise at the bottom of the ocean floor in a huge fault zone. The sea floor where the Navy was exercising has a huge fault zone, and strong magnetic anomalies have been observed. In other words, EMF anomalies were frequently observed at the exercise site. Ryan Graves&apos; brain image, influenced by the EMF anomalies, showed the orb as a &quot;cube inside a sphere.

- The EMF anomalies caused many orb occurrences, which resulted in tic-tac UFOs and numerous UAPs surrounding US Navy vessels.

- At this point, there is a 60-70% chance that the upper echelons of the Navy are aware of this (fault zones on the seafloor → orb occurrence)(*1).  There is also a 20% possibility that the Navy was experimenting with orb-generating weapons developed by the Navy in the confusion of this phenomenon. That is my opinion.

- I have already mentioned another data that strongly suggests a &quot;fault zone on the seafloor → orb generation&quot; at this site in my previous article below.
