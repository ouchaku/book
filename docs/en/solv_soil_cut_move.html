<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
- This topic has been reported since 3:00. It was a mysterious incident that occurred in Hessdalen, Norway, near the famous UFO sighting zone.

- A wet grassy ground surface was cut off and placed a few meters away from the site. The total weight of the cut surface weighed as much as two tons. The cut appears to have been made with a laser, but there is no evidence of any earth-moving equipment in the area, and the site is in the middle of nowhere.

- I saw an article around the beginning of spring that the mystery of such a phenomenon had been solved, but I forgot to introduce it. Unfortunately, I forgot to record the source article, so I will introduce the mystery that has been solved based on my vague memory of the source article if I cannot find it in a search by the next time.

unraveled by Leslie Donovan from the air

you can see what scientists call a

phenomenon somehow a large chunk of
0:24
Earth was plucked from the ground and
0:25
dropped down some 70 feet away two ways
0:29
coming together all right where they
0:30
meet you get an amplification of of the
0:33

0:36
seen anything like this he says not
0:38
humans nor machines could have moved a
0:40
chunk of Earth this huge without leaving
0:42
a trace you know at first I was rather
0:45
skeptical wondering if if someone had
0:47
come up here and was trying to pull a
0:48
hoax being in such a remote area like
0:50
this the likelihood that being
0:52
discovered would be almost nil to start
0:55
with and then looking around the area
0:57
and seeing that that there isn&apos;t any
0:59
indication that man had done it it&apos;s
1:02
it&apos;s real intriguing scientists figured
1:04
that chunk weighs about three tons and

perfectly matches the whole like a

- I saw a source article some years ago about these cases that unraveled the mystery of what they are. But I forgot to record the site of the source article and have yet to find it.

- I knew I should have recorded interesting material, whether incomplete or halfway through, &quot;with a link to the source article,&quot; on the spot, and posted it that day.

- I should have finished this article based on the source article, but that would have been too late and probably would have been forgotten. I will describe the identity of this mystery based on my hazy memory of many years ago.


- The cause of this mystery is a lightning strike on the ground. The energy of the lightning strike caused the water in the soil just below the surface to evaporate explosively, and the force of the evaporation &quot;cut off the surface of the wet meadow and placed it several meters away.&quot;

- The lost source article referred to one paper that investigated a similar case (which occurred in a completely different location than the Norwegian site above) in detail. It also found evidence of lightning scorch marks on the ground at a site where &quot;the ground surface of a wet meadow had been cut away and placed several meters away.&quot; The authoer then argued that the cut marks, which looked like laser cuts in straight lines, could also be caused by lightning strikes.


- If I see that source article or paper in the future, I would like to add it.
