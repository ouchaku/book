<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
- First, I will discuss a specific example of the &quot;Oz factor&quot; (the phenomenon of silence in the surroundings). Next, I will explain why and how such a phenomenon occurs.


<h3 id="specific-examples">Specific examples</h3>
- From Dr. Lynne Kitei&apos;s testimonial video.

- When I witnessed the orb, I was enveloped in a strange stillness that felt as if time had stopped.

- I also had a strong feeling that the orb was observing me.

11:28
they&apos;re on the website anybody who goes
11:29
to the photo page mean excites network
11:31
website you&apos;ll see those two lower orbs
11:33
in the lower left corner
11:36
but immediately noticed an eerie silence
11:39
as if time had stopped it was just
11:41
bizarre and as intently as i was
11:43
watching those two lower orbs i have to
11:46
admit which i did not for two years till
11:49
after the mass sighting
11:51
that it felt like something was watching
11:53
me
11:54
and going through my mind i was thinking
11:56
who are you what are you do you know

Dr. Lynne Kitei on The Phoenix Lights

<h3 id="my-hypothesis">My hypothesis</h3>
- Dr. Lynne Kitei&apos;s case above is another typical Oz factor phenomenon. We have discussed many cases of Oz factor phenomena in previous articles (*1) below.

- When the sensation of this phenomenon intensifies, even the surrounding people feel as if they have frozen to a standstill.

- This strange sensation of stopping may be the result of impaired consciousness caused by EMF abnormality(*2). The patient must have felt the following.

　　- The ambient sound has disappeared.
　　- The traffic on the busy road had stopped.
　　- People around me had frozen to a standstill.

- In reality, however, it is not that the surroundings have changed, but rather a functional decline in the person&apos;s awareness that has occurred. In other words, the cognitive function to grasp changes in the surrounding environment in real time has deteriorated.

- For example, in a disorder of consciousness called Akinetopsia (*3), a person has difficulty even crossing a pedestrian crossing because moving vehicles appear to stop.

<h4 id="3">(*3)</h4>

<blockquote>
Akinetopsia

Akinetopsia also known as cerebral akinetopsia or motion blindness, is a rare neuropsychological disorder in which a patient specifically loses the ability to perceive visual motion despite being able to see stationary objects without issue following cortical lesions outside the striate cortex 1). Reportedly, bilateral cortical injury might be necessary for symptomatic akinetopsia 2). However, Cooper et al. 3) reported that unilateral lesions can induce global akinetopsia as well. People with akinetopsia see the world as a series of freeze-frame images. Patients with akinetopsia say that smooth movements of objects appear as a discontinuous freeze frame image 4). Therefore, patients have difficulty, for example, in pouring tea into a cup because the fluid appears to be frozen, like a glacier 5). Patients with akinetopsia often bump in things, get confused about how things got moved around, have difficulty in crossing roads and driving and are accident-prone.

Cerebral akinetopsia symptom is believed to result from damage to the visual motion pathway, especially area V5/medial temporal cortex (MT) complex 6). Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation study revealed that akinetopsia can be induced selectively and temporarily by magnetic stimulation of area MT/V5 in healthy subjects 7). Akinetopsia was also reported in patients with traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, and stroke 8). Sakurai et al describe a patient who showed akinetopsia recurrently as epileptic seizures 9).
