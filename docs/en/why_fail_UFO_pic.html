- Malcolm Robinson&apos;s own UFO sighting experience inspired the title of this article.

- In Malcolm Robinson&apos;s case below, what appears is not a so-called UFO or orb, but a strange strip of light in the night sky, but even if it were a UFO, the case of the title would be just as valid.

i had a camera around my

The Most Significant Scottish UFO &amp; Paranormal Incident EVER Recorded

<h3 id="the-real-reason-you-missed-photographing-a-ufo">The Real Reason You Missed Photographing a UFO</h3>
- Suppose you brought your camera with the intention of photographing a UFO when it appeared. If it is a small spot of light in the night sky, it is unlikely that you will forget to photograph it, but there are many cases where you somehow forget to photograph a UFO that appears at a short distance from you. (In the rare cases where you do remember to take a picture, it is usually only a small blurry speck...)

- Many UFO witnesses, including Jay (*1) of Project Unity, testified as follows

　　- (a) I could not take my eyes off the UFO even for a moment. I was afraid that if I took my eyes off the UFO, it would disappear.

　　- (b) They were so overwhelmed and stunned by the UFO that they forgot about the camera.

- However, a and b are interpretations added after the incident, and the real reason is most likely as follows.

　　- During the hallucination of the UFO, the witness is in a temporary stupor, unable to think or judge normally.

- Therefore, whether the UFOs appear for a few seconds or for 20 minutes, while they are appearing (i.e., while they are hallucinating), they are in the midst of a disturbance of consciousness, so they do not have the active will to take pictures in the first place. When the patient finally recovers from the disturbance to a level where he or she can take pictures, the hallucination of the UFO has disappeared. I can tell you this is a very well-designed mechanism (laughter).

- For the above reasons, in most cases, we fail to photograph UFOs.

<h3 id="additional">Additional</h3>
- If my above theory is correct, the following is derived: In 99.9% (*2) of cases, the following is true.

　　- (1) So-called &quot;real UFOs&quot; cannot be photographed.

　　- (2) The captured UFO image is one of the following

　　　　　　- The kind of prototypes created by humans.
　　　　　　- Fabrication
　　　　　　- Natural phenomena that resemble UFOs (e.g., lens-shaped clouds)
　　　　　　- An object of easily misidentified shape (e.g., airship) was accidentally captured on the image.


- Thus, for example, if the photo in the case below is not a fabrication, then this identity is a prototype of sorts, or a test of a special kind of airship.

- I will deal with the famous UFO photo below in a separate article at some point, but I have determined that this is not the so-called UFO with ET on it.

<h4 id="2">(*2)</h4>
- 99.9% …

- According to above assumption, there is an inherent difficulty in having enough data to make it an universal proposition. Therefore, I will assume 99.9%. In other words, I am providing a way out (laughter)
