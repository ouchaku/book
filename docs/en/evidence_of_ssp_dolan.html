<h3 id="past-article-history">Past article history</h3>
(2021-07-19) Added a video I saw of the scene mentioned in the comments.
(2021-05-23) Created

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- Richard Dolan is a firm believer in the existence of &quot;breakway civilazation&quot; (=SSP) and frequently asserts it in his speeches.

- In the following video, he discusses a video clip that he claims is one of the &quot;strong evidences&quot; of the breakway civilazation.

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
- A strange object is seen in the image taken from a satellite.

- In 2005, Jeff Challender (deceased) found this scene. The object moves from right to left, then makes a U-turn and returns.

- This reversed object is one of the evidences for the existence of &quot;breakway civilazation&quot; (=SSP).

there&apos;s another reason that i think we
03:40
have a secret space program
03:42
there are lots and lots of recorded
03:45
strange
03:46
happenings in earth orbit many
03:49
what are these things jeff challenger uh
03:53
is no longer alive unfortunately he was
03:56
a guy who was absolutely dedicated to uh
03:59
getting copies of nasa space missions
04:02
and then studying them fanatically
04:07
uh jeff jeff was physically disabled i
04:09
mean he really couldn&apos;t get out easily
04:11
so this is what he did
04:12
and he spent his entire day after day
04:16
uh going through these and just looking
04:18
for things and
04:20
and to his credit he was a very
04:21
level-headed person if he and he doesn&apos;t
04:23
just say everything&apos;s a ufo
04:25
he was a very clear-headed person in my
04:28
own view
04:29
but there are a lot of things that he
04:30
noticed on the various space missions
04:32
that are
04:33
very difficult to explain such as this
04:35
next thing that i&apos;m going to show you
04:37
this is a repeating clip so just keep
04:39
watching it&apos;s been speeded up
04:41
also okay so in actuality this clip is
04:45
more than two minutes but he&apos;s got it so
04:48
that it&apos;s like two seconds and you see
04:49
an object doing what appears to be a
04:51
u-turn
04:52
in space i&apos;m going to show you an
04:54
enhancement of it in just a moment
04:56
let&apos;s do the enhancement so that there&apos;s
04:59
an image stabilization going on and you
05:00
can see it actually
05:02
seeming to maneuver
05:06
now this is in earth orbit during a nasa
05:08
mission from 2005.
05:11
what do they represent well here&apos;s one
05:12
thing i would say
05:14
maybe we made those things maybe we
05:16
didn&apos;t make those things now if we
05:17
didn&apos;t make those
05:18
things i would still say that&apos;s probably
05:21
good evidence for a secret space program
05:23
because after all
05:24
if someone&apos;s making things that are
05:26
doing that in space
05:28
certainly there would be more than
05:29
enough motivation to have a secret space
05:31
program to go out there
05:33
and to deal with it or investigate it
05:36
obviously and of course if
05:38
well if we made those things and that&apos;s
05:40
de facto proof of the secret space
05:41
program
05:43
so there are strange enough things
05:45
happening that i think would warrant it
05:47
there&apos;s so much more a breakaway
05:51
civilization

Richard Dolan - The Implications of Advanced Flying Crafts of Unknown Origin
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTiyRVoeB9s" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>

<h3 id="my-view-1">My view 1</h3>
- Richard Dolan claims that the U-turned object is a spacecraft belonging to the &quot;breakway civilazation&quot; (=SSP), which employs innovative Earth-made technology.

- Richard Dolan does not say whether NASA, which shot the video, has released any comment on the matter.

- However, even without NASA&apos;s explanation, we can assume the identity of the U-turned object. The object is probably some sort of microscopic debris, water droplets, or waste surrounding the satellite that shot this video, which was captured by the camera.

- Richard Dolan is critical of the object&apos;s U-turn and jumps to the SSP spacecraft theory, but the U-turn can be explained by static electricity.

- The satellite is charged by the solar wind (plasma) that pours down on it. Because of the protrusions - antennas, solar panels, and attitude control motors - it can be estimated that the electric field distribution around the satellite varies extremely steeply and complexly in space and time.

- The fine dust and water droplets surrounding the satellite are subjected to a force of F = qE due to the electric field around the satellite. The sudden change in the electric field distribution around the satellite can naturally cause the fine debris to make a U-turn.



<h3 id="my-view-2">MY view 2</h3>
- I remembered a similar video scene taken from a satellite. It was uploaded on Youtube, and the source seemed to be an old TV special on UFOs.

- I have a vague recollection of the video scene, but it looks like this.

　　- At first,  light spot A was seen moving from the upper right to the left of the screen. Suddenly, the light spot made a U-turn and turned back.
　　- Immediately after that, a light spot B passed in a straight line quickly from the lower left to the upper right of the screen.
　　- It appeared as if A anticipated B&apos;s attack and avoided it.


- That video scene can probably be explained by a sudden change in the electrostatic field around the satellite; it seems that both A and B simply changed their orbits due to a sudden change in the field distribution caused by an electric discharge from a protruding part of the satellite.

- The above explanation is mediocre and not enough to be called a riddle. Therefore, the 80% rule was not applied.

 I saw the video scene in question and have added it below.

<li>Richard Dolan had long believed that &quot;Gary McKinnon had seen classified NASA material on the Solar warden.&quot;  Later, Richard Dolan invited Gary McKinnon himself for an interview, and Gary McKinnon categorically denied it. The story of how this happened is covered in the past article below.</li>

<blockquote>
- 10:45 

- Q) You found the material of the top-secret space fleet (&quot;solar warden&quot;), right?

- A) No! It&apos;s a hoax.

　(Richard Dolan is astonished by the unexpected reply.)


- 11:30  In fact, this is what happened. I found an Excel document. That Excel document had a column for &quot;non-terrestrial officer,&quot; but that does not mean &quot;ET.&quot; Non-terrestrial officer&quot; may mean living off-planet (i.e., satellite) (not on Earth).


- Q) What do you think now?

- A) ...Maybe it&apos;s a human soldier serving in an extraterrestrial (location).

- 13:05 It would be someone who works at a secret base such as Mars. I think it is around the Navy.
