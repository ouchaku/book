<blockquote>
i&apos;m going to
39:47
tell you are hard to believe
39:49
and they were hard to believe for me too
39:51
i want to assure you
39:52
that nothing of what i&apos;m claiming is
39:55
made up
39:56
or invented i&apos;m just being honest i&apos;m
39:59
just going to convey
40:00
the facts as they happen to me and
40:03
here&apos;s a big one
40:05
all right that&apos;s me with my mother
40:08
who&apos;s deceased she died at age 92.
40:12
and this is a picture taken on the day
40:14
of
40:16
their engagement i wrote 1941 there it
40:20
might be 1940 i&apos;m not sure but it
40:21
doesn&apos;t really matter it&apos;s my mom
40:23
mom and dad and
40:27
this picture that&apos;s all blurred and
40:31
you know you can&apos;t really make it out
40:33
there&apos;s something wrong with this
40:34
picture
40:35
when i scanned it i didn&apos;t look at it
40:37
very carefully i was
40:39
scanning family pictures to put in an
40:41
album i scanned this one i said oh
40:42
that&apos;s a dud
40:44
should i throw it away you know does
40:46
this even belong in a family album
40:48
and i said well it&apos;s historic i&apos;ll keep
40:50
it anyway
40:52
and it wasn&apos;t until about 10 years later
40:55
that i took a careful look at the
40:56
picture and i want to show you what i
40:59
discovered
41:00
okay you see it says 1940 at the top
41:03
it says engaged it says brooklyn college
41:07
now look this is a sticky on it was
41:10
in an album and it&apos;s not blurred the
41:13
word engaged is
41:14
not blurred 1940 is not blurred but
41:17
there&apos;s something
41:18
really weird going on in that picture
41:21
and i&apos;m going to go closer in
41:23
to start talking about it in detail my
41:26
dad&apos;s got two left arms
41:28
there
41:32
they&apos;re holding hands there um let&apos;s go
41:35
closer still you can see how
41:37
in focus everything is except the
41:39
picture itself
41:42
now look my father has two noses here
41:46
this nose is his nose as uh he looked as
41:50
a young man at that age
41:51
this was his nose when he was like 40 or
41:54
50 years older than that
41:56
it was larger he has two ears here
42:00
he has three ties
42:04
she has one and a half pendants
42:07
now if you want to say double exposure
42:09
no no double exposure everything would
42:11
be she he has three ties she&apos;d have
42:13
three pendants
42:14
but that isn&apos;t what it is but the most
42:17
strange thing of all
42:18
is that in between their two heads
42:22
are two children
42:25
this was taken seven years before i was
42:29
born
42:31
that&apos;s me as a boy that&apos;s my sister
42:37
and behind there&apos;s a blonde woman
42:42
you can see her partner hair her hair
42:44
her nose there
42:46
i don&apos;t know who that is
42:49
but i know she also shows up in the left
42:53
side of the picture i want to go in
42:56
closer so now you can really see
43:01
that&apos;s definitely me as a boy that&apos;s
43:03
definitely
43:04
my sister i would say that she was
43:07
around
43:10
for or five and i was
43:14
probably eight or nine so
43:18
you want to believe in time travel how
43:20
does the picture taken in 1940
43:22
have me and her in it i haven&apos;t got a
43:25
clue and i almost threw the picture away
43:29
now i said my mother died in
43:33
she was 92 died in august of 2013.

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- Why was his future image captured in a photograph taken before his birth?  This mystery will be solved specifically below.

<h3 id="solving-the-mystery-of-the-photo-in-question">Solving the mystery of the photo in question</h3>
- Photographic paper for film photography often warps and rises in the center of the paper(*1). The central part of the image is occupied by the subject that is the focus of attention. In this case, it could be two engaged couples or their children (siblings).

- The photographic paper of the photograph is then pasted into the family album. In some cases, the surfaces of the raised center of the photos pasted on opposite sides of the album adhere to each other. When the album is opened, the adhered area peels off and sticks to the photographic paper on the opposite side.

- To put it plainly.... Suppose the album has a photo of the engagement in question on the left page and a photo of the siblings on the right page. Since the album is kept closed, the surfaces of the photos may adhere to each other(*2). When the album was opened, the photosensitive part of the adhering area must have been thinly peeled off and transferred. (The photo of the siblings with their faces peeled off was destroyed, so it probably no longer exists.)


- This is illustrated below.

<a href="../img/20220622_cmt.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220622_cmt.jpg" src="../img/20220622_cmt.jpg"></a>


- From the writing marks in the lower right margin of the photo in question, it can be inferred that this photo was removed from an album.

<a href="../img/20200907_pic1_cmt2.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20200907_pic1_cmt2.jpg" src="../img/20200907_pic1_cmt2.jpg"></a>

- Paul Davids only saw the photo in the state it was removed from the album, so he assumed it was paranormal because he &quot;saw me and my sister in the photo seven years before I was born.


<h4 id="supplement">supplement</h4>
- Paul Davids denies that the photo of the engaged couple has multiple exposures, for two reasons:

　　(1) The mother&apos;s necklace is double layered, but the father&apos;s tie is triple layered.
　　(2) The father&apos;s left arm is doubled. Father&apos;s left arm is doubled, but they are far apart.

　but we can conclude that the mother was only relatively still. 


- Paul Davids interprets these double and triple sections as paranormal rather than multiple exposures, but that&apos;s a stretch.

- Paul Davids is a filmmaker and a visual expert. The fact that he is so oblivious to what I, a layman, would have immediately thought of is probably because he has been dominated by his belief in the paranormal.


<h3 id="1">(*1)</h3>
- The back side of a developed photograph does not absorb water because of the resin coating, but the photosensitive material side absorbs water and stretches. As a result, the photographic paper warps in a shape where the image surface is convex.

<h3 id="（2）">（*2）</h3>
- It is not uncommon for the surfaces of photographic paper to stick together. A concrete example of this is shown below.

<blockquote>
Is there any way to cleanly remove old photos that are stuck together surface to surface?
These are old photos, over 20-40 years old, and I stored them in a humid warehouse about 10 years ago.

- When I took them out a few years later and tried to open them, I couldn&apos;t see them because the surfaces of the photos were stuck together.
(It is not the kind of album that is sandwiched between thin membranes like now, but the kind that is held in place by something like a triangular corner.)

If you know how to remove it without tearing it, please let me know.

<blockquote>
Regarding the photo with the printed surface stuck to it.

Due to my poor storage, a photo I printed at a photo shop a long time ago and a photo I printed at home the other day got stuck together.

I was in such a hurry that I peeled it off and left the printed side of the new photo on the old one.

It is an old photo, so there is no film left, and I am hoping it can be cleaned up. Since I have removed the film, is there anything I can do?
