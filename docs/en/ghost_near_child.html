<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
- (2018-02-07 added) When I was writing one article (UFO photo taken by father), I remembered that this article was incomplete. Before I forget, I&apos;ll add the answer.

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- The father took a picture of his sick young daughter playing. Later, when he looked at the developed photo, he saw a strange woman right behind his daughter. This is the main story.

- If you look at the photo in question (below), you can see a woman with long hair wearing a red short-sleeved dress and glasses standing directly behind the daughter.

- The father testified that no one was near his daughter when he took the picture. The father believes that the Virgin Mary appeared to him out of concern for his daughter&apos;s illness (leukemia). However, some people consider it as ET.

- However, if you look closely at this photo, you will immediately recognize the identity of the Virgin Mary or ET. It is a small, blurry photo, but it should be easy, because the hints about the identity of this woman are blatantly obvious in the photo.

- The photo is not a fabrication. It is not a double exposure. It is not a reflection of glass. Nor is it a reflection of someone else who happened to be nearby. Nor is it a camera malfunction. Nor was it the result of a prank by someone who was unaware of the photographer. Of course, it is not a ghost of any kind. There is a reasonable explanation.

- If you are aware of this identity, please write a &quot;hint&quot; of the identity in the comments section. The best hints are those that make sense to those who know the correct answer, but are unclear to those who do not know the correct answer.

- In addition, I think it is not entertaining to state the correct answer easily in a few days like last time, because it takes away the reader&apos;s enjoyment of guessing. Therefore, I plan to leave it for a while if there are no respondents. In that case, I will add the correct answer a month or so later (unless I forget...).

“A family from Kirkland, Ohio got a supernatural shock in May 2013 when they were looking over photos of their young daughter and noticed a figure hovering near her.”

The father of the cured child believed that the ghost was Virgin Mary. Others believed that this may have been an alien being.

“My reaction immediately, it&apos;s Mary, they hear us, she&apos;s there. I didn&apos;t necessarily see it as a sign that Erin is fine and is going to walk out of this, but it&apos;s a sign that we&apos;re watching over her.&quot;

The report describes how the child was diagnosed with cancer.

“Erin was diagnosed with leukemia in February 2007 and since gone through numerous bone marrow transplants. When the miraculous photo was taken, she was about to undergo her second transplant.”

When asked to provide his opinion about those who were skeptical of the incident, Erin’s father provided a different opinion and remained firm on his belief.

“I know she&apos;s not alone, I know we are not alone and people who don&apos;t want to believe it, that&apos;s OK. Whatever happened, you know something powerful and special was there with us I definitely have my moments when I&apos;m falling apart and I&apos;m terrified and I literally grab my phone and I stare at that picture.&quot;

(The following is the part added on 2018-02-08)

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- As usual, I had completely forgotten about this article, but I remembered it in one of the previous articles. So I&apos;ll list the answer before I forget.

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>
- The &quot;woman with long hair wearing a red short-sleeved dress and glasses&quot; who appears to be standing directly behind the child is actually the smoke from the fireworks illuminated by the flash of light.

- The illustration below should convince you.

<h3 id="to-add">To add...</h3>
- It should be a mere coincidence that the smoke illuminated by the flash of light looks like &quot;a woman with long hair wearing a red short-sleeved dress and glasses. However, there is a slight possibility that this is not a mere coincidence.

- That is...the possibility of what Jung calls &quot;meaningful coincidence&quot;.
