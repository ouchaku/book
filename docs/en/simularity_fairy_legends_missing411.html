<h3 id="summary">summary</h3>
・43:30 The similarities between the fairy legend and Missing-411 are as follows.

　　- Fairies move in storms. (The weather turns stormy right after the Missing-411 incident.)

　　- Dogs hate and fear fairies (hence police dogs do not try to track them.)

　　- Victims&apos; clothes are often brightly colored.

　　- Incidents occur while searching for wild strawberries.

　　- They are often found in granite areas.

　　- Victims&apos; consciousness is altered and they lose their sense of place, even though they are familiar with the area.

37:12
but i think there are things that that are deserving of deserving of our attention and similarly you know
37:17
this this sort of uh sanitization that you find of fairy lore in the modern uh in the modern sort of
37:24
pop culture is one of the reasons that i think people haven&apos;t been uh considering it as a method or a means
37:31
rather to explain at least some of these missing 4-1-1 disappearances um
37:36
one of the things that you&apos;ll find that that is so i mean so i&apos;ve said this before but i think it&apos;s worth saying again
37:41
missing 4-1-1 is a paranormal rorschach test whatever you&apos;re into is what you&apos;re going to see now honestly
37:48
i see the irony in me being into fairy lore and seeing fairies but hear me out um you know some of these data points
37:55
that don&apos;t seem to make as much sense like oh the idea that you know what&apos;s alien abduction because
38:00
aliens will abduct you well then why do so many disappearances have these weird weather effects why do
38:07
they take place near uh boulder fields why do they take place while berry picking but in the british and irish and
38:14
scottish fairy lore in particular you&apos;ll find other ideas around the world these are all things that are
38:20
incorporated into into fairy belief the idea that i mean there&apos;s there&apos;s a there&apos;s a book on my shelf that has an entire essay
38:26
dedicated to stories of children who uh go berry picking in newfoundland where
38:32
there was a strong fairy belief and either saw fairies at the berry bush were attempted to be kidnapped
38:38
were kidnapped and came back or came back in a daze which are all things that are missing 4-1-1 motif similarly
38:44
in iceland and other places in scandinavia boulder fields were the homes of fairies in a lot of these traditions from i mean
38:51
the native americans to the middle eastern cultures to the british isles fairies traveled on
38:59
storms they traveled on whirlwinds and this when you combine all this with the propensity of
39:04
these beings and a lot of these different cultures to steal people it&apos;s it&apos;s an explanation as out there as it sort of sounds here&apos;s
39:10
the thing i don&apos;t know what the fairy faith was describing
39:19
and i don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening in missing 4-1-1 but setting aside i think they&apos;re the same thing i don&apos;t
39:24
know that does this mean is josh saying that fairies are abducting people no i&apos;m not i&apos;m just saying that
39:30
this was their way of describing the missing 4-1-1 phenomena and our missing 4-1-1 phenomena is is our way of
39:35
describing the way that people would go missing in in fairyland and you can just go down the list i mean there&apos;s a really i sort

<h3 id="my-opinion">my opinion</h3>
- David Paulides does not emphasize &quot;wild strawberry picking&quot; as a characteristic of missing-411; David Paulides always mentions &quot;bad weather, waterfront, and granite&quot; as three characteristics.

- Thus, Joshua Cutchin&apos;s discussion of the strange similarities between the fairy legends and Missing-411 are three points, all of which can be explained by the hypotheses in the previous articles below(*1).

　　- Bad weather
　　- Surrounding megaliths (granite)
　　- The missing person who was found was in a daze.
