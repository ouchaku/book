<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- This matter is currently under investigation, so it has not reached the level where a completed article can be written. However, if I aim for its completion, there is no prospect that it will be finished anytime soon. Therefore, I have decided to include the following article as a memo of the progress of the investigation, even though it is at an incomplete level and may contain unclear meanings.

- This article is a continuation of a previous article below, 

　　<a href="http://news21c.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-16018.html" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://news21c.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-16018.html" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://news21c.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-16018.html" target="_blank">http://news21c.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-16018.html</a>


- In the following, I will concentrate on the case of:

　　<a href="http://news21c.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-15503.html" target="_blank">&quot;Pentagon team dies of mysterious cranial cavity during channeling experiment with ET&quot;.</a> (2020-02-28)  (Japanese)

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
- The story told by the Pentagon scientists and the photographs shown are all almost certainly fabrications. In other words, both the photos and the description of the circumstances of the deaths(as bellow) were definitely faked.

<blockquote>
- Ray Boeche was told from two Department of Defense scientists. Ray Boeche has verified the identities of both men.

- Three people who had been communicating psychically with ET died. He were shown photographs of their deaths. The photos showed the three people sitting in a chair (*1) like a dentist&apos;s. The chair was flanked by equipment.

- One had suffered a heart attack, and the other&apos;s skull had been crushed internally, as if under pressure from the outside. The depression in the skull was two inches in diameter.

...

- The specific circumstances under which the three member died during the interactive experiments were: heart attack, asphyxiation, and skull entrapment. In 1991, Ray Boeche was shown photographs by a visiting Pentagon official.

</blockquote>

- Neither Nick Redfern nor Ray Boeche were aware of this fabrication.

- Nick Redfern was not only unaware of the fabrication, but also became an unwitting collaborator in the Pentagon&apos;s UFO disinformation effort.

(2020-05-30 begin)

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- To explain the &quot;evidence of fabrication&quot; (if I try to do it properly), is still dull. Digestion of the accumulated articles will be greatly delayed. So, I will put it off for a while, or, if possible, hope that someone else will do it for me.


<h3 id="i-encourage-you-to-solve-this-mystery">I encourage you to solve this mystery.</h3>
- In fact, it is quite easy to understand that &quot;all the stories told by Pentagon scientists and the pictures they showed are almost certainly fabrications.&quot;

- No research or prior knowledge is required. No need to search the web. No need to watch videos. The description quoted in the conclusion above is all the information you need.

- In most cases, it is impossible to show that a photo is faked unless you have seen the photo. However, in this case, it is not even necessary to have seen the photo. A junior high school student&apos;s level of general knowledge would suffice.

- Furthermore, the photo in question is not even a reproduction (created for later commentary). In other words, the original incident itself, which was to be recreated and photographed, never occurred in the first place. It is impossible to show this at the junior high school level, but the knowledge of an ordinary member of society is sufficient.

- Therefore, if you are a UFO enthusiast, I suggest that you find some concrete evidence that the photo in question cannot be real. It is rare to find such a simple and straightforward case. I can assure you that it is good training to spot a fabrication. (Though it&apos;s too easy for those with good instincts to train themselves.)

- It has been a month since the last article. No one seems to be interested in this matter, but in the midst of a pandemic, it is rather healthy and desirable not to be interested in such a crazy topic.

- I&apos;ll finish explaining the &quot;fake evidence&quot; before I forget. The details will come later.

<h3 id="proof-that-the-photos-are-faked">Proof that the photos are faked</h3>
- First, I will restate the portion of the article that refers to the photographs in question.



<blockquote>
- Ray Boeche was told from two Department of Defense scientists. Ray Boeche has verified the identities of both men.

- Three people who had been communicating psychically with ET died. He were shown photographs of their deaths. The photos showed the three people sitting in a chair (*1) like a dentist&apos;s. The chair was flanked by equipment.

</blockquote>

- The Pentagon scientists said the three victims died of skull entrapment, heart attack, and asphyxiation, and showed pictures of the conditions under which they died while sitting in reclining chairs... This is the core of the fabricated evidence.

- If someone suffers a heart attack or suffocation during an experiment, it is common practice to immediately remove them from their reclining chair to the floor and administer first aid and lifesaving measures. Large organizations everywhere conduct regular life-saving drills to prepare for such an emergency response. That is, cardiac massage and artificial respiration until an ambulance arrives. The Pentagon is supposed to have AEDs for electroshock installed in various locations, so they rush to bring them out and use them to save the victim&apos;s life.

- If someone is stupid enough to leisurely take pictures of the damage while a heart attack or asphyxiation victim is in a reclining chair, he or she will be severely reprimanded. Even if (and only because) the victim has already stopped breathing and beating, life-saving measures must be given top priority.

- If they fail to provide the necessary lifesaving care, the supervisor of the department and the head of the organization will be removed from office.It does not matter if it is a top-secret project or not.

- And if there are three fatalities at the same time, it is futile to insist that the life-saving procedures were flawless. These photos blatantly and completely disproves that claim.

- Therefore, these photos cannot be authentic. They are completely fabricated photographs.

<blockquote>
host:

so back to the to DoD
21:48
physicists and rabo Shay that you they
21:51
continued their experimentation
21:54
contacting the NA cheese and on human
21:56
entities is what they originally called
21:58
him believing they were going to be
22:00
speaking with extraterrestrials but then
22:02
it turned out in their opinion that they
22:04
were talking to demons instead and
22:07
during these experience experiments
22:09
there were deaths that were involved you
22:13
know with the people that
22:14
we&apos;re doing the experimentation do you
22:15
have any details on how they died or
22:18
what experiments they were doing when
22:20
they died?


-----
Nick Redfern:

oh yeah I mean rate actually
22:23
openly told me that when he met these
22:24
two DoD guys they brought a briefcase
22:26
with them and opened it and showed him a
22:29
number of photographs of people who had
22:31
died in these experiments and as I said
22:34
basically the idea of the contact was to
22:38
sort of use my apparent psychic powers
22:40
and altered states to sort of project a
22:42
thought out to these entities and then
22:45
have almost like a psychic conversation
22:47
it wasn&apos;t like the graves were
22:49
materializing in the Pentagon or
22:51
anything like that but the the
22:54
photographs ray told me all showed
22:57
different people sitting in what he
22:58
describes look like dentist&apos;s chairs and
23:01
he said that the the photographs all
23:05
showed dead people sitting in these
23:07
dentists like chairs and one was a man
23:10
who supposedly died suddenly of a heart
23:12
attack in the middle of these
23:13
experiments another one died in a weird
23:18
fashion through suffocation where they
23:20
could never determine how the person had
23:22
suffocated it was almost like you know
23:24
like an invisible hand gripped around
23:26
the throat and strangled and suffocated
23:28
in that way and the weirdest one of all
23:30
was where somebody at literally their
23:33
head it sort of caved in on one side as
23:37
if it had been sort of smashed with like
23:39
a hammer you know somebody just hit you
23:41
on the side of the head really hard with
23:42
a hammer and it was like a crushing
23:43
effect to the skull and this all
23:47
occurred during the course of these
23:49
experiments and of course this was sort
23:51
of gain perceived as like a like a
23:53
psychic backlash that they were trying
23:55
to put a thought out there to contact
23:58
these things and next thing that the
24:00
people involved are just dying left
24:02
right and center and and again that&apos;s
24:04
what led the the people on the program
24:07
to think well hang on a minute if we&apos;re
24:09
just dealing with nuts and bolts aliens
24:11
why is this happening and again that was
24:15
perceived as part of this whole sort of
24:17
black cloud coming over the the project
24:19
and of course in like people outside of
24:22
the Pentagon
24:24
you know just members of the public who
24:25
dabble in a lot of these sort of stuff
24:27
it was like well now we&apos;ve opened the
24:29
door how do we close it and that was a
24:31
big problem again you knows what have we
24:33
done you know what have we unleashed



-----
host:

so
24:35
they actually took photographs and
24:38
documented the deaths of these three men
24:40
I&apos;m assuming they were men



-----

Nick:
no two women
24:43
I think one was a woman


-----
host:
but they
24:46
photograph their dead bodies in the
24:47
chair where they died at the point of
24:50
the experiment

-----
Nick:
yeah right absolutely I
24:53
mean ray told me on the record but he
24:56
saw the photographs he said that they
24:58
took me photographs out of this
24:59
briefcase and showed them to him and he
25:02
saw the dead bodies sitting in these
25:05
sort of dentists type chair type things
25:08
now ray said he had no idea and he
25:11
wasn&apos;t told where the pictures were
25:13
taken or exactly when you know it could
25:15
have been this was 91 when Ray had the
25:17
first meeting with them so it could have
25:20
in the 80s it could have in the 70s we
25:22
really don&apos;t know and he didn&apos;t know but
25:24
they said you know you could tell that
25:27
they didn&apos;t look like staged photographs
25:29
or anything like that you know to try
25:31
and deceive him or whatever it was some
25:33
sort of weird you know mind based
25:35
experiments that they were trying to
25:37
play on ray he said he looked you know
25:39
just like the real things


-----
host:
well so now
25:42
the the one that died with the sunken
25:46
skull yeah
25:47
was there any trauma to the skull as far
25:51
as abrasions or blood spatter or
25:55
bleeding or was it just caved in



-----
Nick:
well I
25:59
don&apos;t know about the blood blood aspect
26:02
of it is although bruising but I do know
26:04
that they said that the cause was like
26:06
blunt force trauma to the head
26:09
but that I truly don&apos;t know anything
26:12
I&apos;ve got a blood angle or the bruising
26:14
and Ray never mentioned that but
26:15
apparently the piece of the blunt force
26:17
trauma was something that was mentioned
26:19
in the I guess like the documentation
26:22
and the paperwork that surrounded
26:24
you know the analysis have had the
26:26
person died or why


-----
host:
that is just
26:29
absolutely insane it&apos;s insane do you
26:32
know if they were Tate if the experiment
26:35
these three people that did the
26:37
experiment if they were using illicit
26:38
drugs to try to attempt to make this
26:40
contact or
26:41
where they sober and just tuning in were
26:44
they suspected to be psychics of in any
26:47
shape way or form


-----
Nick:
well we don&apos;t really
26:50
know all the details but I mean they
26:52
would have to have some psychic
26:54
abilities because the whole point of the
26:56
program was to try and contact me the
26:58
nhe psychically I think they might use
27:01
utilized their powers now one of the
27:05
theories of course is that maybe the
27:07
powers that they were trying to
27:08
understand and militarize who actually
27:10
used again to that you know that was the
27:13
whole point one of the one of the key
27:15
issues of the program was whether or not
27:17
sort of a psychic powers that these
27:20
creatures possessed could be used the
27:22
sort of Calif like firing ranges you
27:24
know you could cause for example like a
27:27
foreign leader to have a sudden heart
27:29
attack or a brain hemorrhage and you
27:31
would just people would just think it
27:32
was down to natural causes but it could
27:34
actually be caused psychically and so I
27:37
think that&apos;s what they were looking into
27:39
you know trying to harness these
27:41
technologies or these paranormal powers
27:44
for for using things like assassination
27:47
and things like that
27:49
but it may be that the tables were
27:51
turned and the very powers that were
27:53
going to be used you know like on an
27:54
enemy leader or whatever we actually
27:57
used on the people in the project so in
27:59
other words I think they must have had
28:00
the ones who died must have had some
28:02
sort of psychic connection or psychic
28:05
skills because clearly they were
28:07
probably chosen you know to take part in
28:09
the project for that reason
