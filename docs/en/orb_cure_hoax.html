- Kathleen Marden (private UFO researcher) discusses in her lecture a video she obtained. The video was taken by a Canadian man (M).

- This video footage taken by M has been discussed in a previous article below.

- At the time of the past article, I didn&apos;t pay much attention to the video and didn&apos;t notice the fabrication. But this time I noticed a fabrication.

40:35--

- The following information was obtained from a Canadian man (M) who contacted me a few months ago.

- M had a large tumor on the back of his neck. So he was scheduled to have surgery at the hospital to remove the tumor. One late night before the surgery, he was lying in bed. An Orb appeared and entered her body. When he woke up the next day, he found that the tumor had shrunk to 1/5 of its original size and Orb had cured it.

<h3 id="my-view">My view</h3>
- Perhaps this video is a fabrication. The reason is as follows.

(2022-06-27 begin)
- When an unknown orb rushes toward your body, anyone would try to avoid it by spinal reflex. However, this photographer did not even twitch. Therefore, there is no blur in the video until the very last moment. This is impossible.

- The first scene is also odd. It seems that the photographer anticipated exactly where the orb would appear and pointed the camera at that spot beforehand.

<blockquote>
Today, 60 years after the UFO abduction of Betty and Henry Hill, more and more people are convinced that UFO&apos;s are real and that governments are covering up their existence. The 1961 abduction of the Hills stirred worldwide interest, primarily because of the book The Interrupted Journey, the subsequent media coverage and a 1975 TV movie, The UFO Incident. The case is mentioned in almost all UFO abduction books. Kathleen Marden, Betty Hill&apos;s niece, shares details from her discussions with Betty and from the evidence of the UFO abduction. She, also, looks at the Hill&apos;s riveting hypnosis sessions about their time onboard the spacecraft.

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- During a recent remote meeting, Grant Cameron brought up this same orb video again and played back the video, which Grant Cameron claims is the best evidence of treatment by orb (*1).

- This time, I saw the replayed video again and noticed a scene that is a definite evidence of fabrication in a different part of the video than the cut-out video in the past article above, so I will record it.

- In addition, I will also add an audio transcript (automatically generated) that talks about the shooting situation.

<h4 id="1">(*1)</h4>
- The purpose of this remote meeting is to promote the idea that &quot;orb is good, not evil.&quot; The circumstances behind this are as follows. In a recently published book (&quot;Skinwalkers at the Pentagon&quot;) and George Knapp makes the following claims:

　　- There have been cases in which military intelligence personnel who visited the Skinwalker ranch were possessed by evil spirits, which then haunted their homes, causing a number of bizarre phenomena. In addition, there have been cases of serious physical harm.

　　- Thus, orb is an evil entity that does terrible harm to human beings.


- The backlash against those claims and statements by a particularly radical faction (Grant Cameron, Alan Steinfeld, Nicole Sakach, Preston Dennett) of the UFO industry&apos;s spiritually biased mainstream was the motivation for this remote meeting.

- Therefore, &quot;orb is not evil, orb is good, there are many cases of ET transforming into orb, there are many cases of orb healing humans,&quot; etc., are appealed to in this remote meeting.

- To top it all off, &quot;orb is the incarnation of a good evolved consciousness, orb may be our original form. I hope so...&quot; and so on.

<h3 id="main-point">main point</h3>
- Grant Cameron describes the scene where the blue-orb jumps into a prone person.

- The scenes cut out as stills below are easy to miss (in fact, no one should have pointed out that this orb video is a fabrication. At least not that I know of), but they are all conclusive evidence of fabrication.

<h3 id="method-of-fabrication">Method of fabrication</h3>
- The fabrication method was to illuminate the walls and floor of the room with a strong light source emitting blue-white convergent light, which was then captured by a video camera. In this method, the position of the light source and the camera inevitably shifted, albeit slightly. Therefore, when there is a difference between walls and floors (e.g., walls and pillars, walls and floors, bed sheets and their backgrounds), the difference between the illuminated areas appears as the bending surface of the reflected light.


<h3 id="illustrating-the-evidence">Illustrating the evidence</h3>
- In fact, the refractive surface in question can be seen in the bumps in the still image cropped above.

- If you look carefully at the still image above, you should be able to see it, but below is an illustration of the area of interest.
