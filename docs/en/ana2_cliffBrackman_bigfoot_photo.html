<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- Bigfoot enthusiasts/researchers can be categorized into two types.

　　- (A) Bigfoot is just an ordinary creature with a large body. Bigfoot has nothing to do with the supernatural. 

　　- (B) Bigfoot is not an ordinary creature, but a temporary appearance from another dimension or world. Therefore, it is accompanied by supernatural phenomena. Bigfoot = emergence from another dimension.


- There are many enthusiasts who have changed their opinion from A to B, but there should be few who change their opinion from B to A.


- One of the A school is Cliff Barackman (below), whose video commentary is below. He emphasizes science to the point of being annoying.

<a href="../img/20220509_Cliff_Barackman.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220509_Cliff_Barackman.jpg" src="../img/20220509_Cliff_Barackman.jpg"></a>

- He criticizes &quot;the spread of bullshit like B on Youtube and podcasts/blogs.

- He then says, &quot;It is my mission to correct such bullshit with correct scientific knowledge, and this video is part of that mission. &quot;

- Record the following as typical examples of the A school (&quot;Bigfoot = ordinary creature&quot; school).

- Below, Cliff Barackman analyzes the photo below using his vaunted scientific method.

<a href="../img/20220509_what0.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220509_what0.jpg" src="../img/20220509_what0.jpg"></a>

- Cliff Barackman argues that, based on his analysis

　　This is Bigfoot&apos;s photographic evidence. This is the surveillance video. The torso is blurred, but this is the back, these are the arms, and these are the legs. I went to the site of the shooting to investigate. Based on the spots on the tree, I&apos;d say this Bigfoot is over 7 ft. tall.

<h3 id="my-view">My view</h3>
- In the web lecture video titled &quot;Bigfoot: Best Evidence,&quot; the first photo he discusses as evidence is the video posted above.

- Is there really any science in the analysis of this footage that would identify it as Bigfoot?

- This video is just a branch falling from a tree, caused by a squirrel or some other animal. The blurred areas are the leaves of the branch. The camera&apos;s exposure time is long because it is nighttime. Therefore, the moving object is blurred and the branch appears thicker.

- Below is a photo taken from inside the car. I went to this site to investigate. It is 7 ft. tall from the height of the white sign. Therefore, this cannot be a human dressed up as a prank.

<a href="../img/20220509_snowman.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220509_snowman.jpg" src="../img/20220509_snowman.jpg"></a>


<h3 id="my-view">My view</h3>
- This identity was simply a human form made out of plowed snow, dressed in old clothes, and given gloves. The photographer must have known this. There is a strong possibility that the person who created this statue took the photo.

- It would be a shame to be fooled by such a simple trick.

<h3 id="summary-of-cliff-barackmans-claims-no3">Summary of Cliff Barackman&apos;s Claims No.3</h3>
- Cliff Barackman is convinced that Patterson/Gimlin&apos;s Bigfoot video is authentic. Therefore, he compares the images from that video with the photos below and makes the following judgments.

- In the upper left photo, the triangular shape on the top of the head is a projection of the head bone that supports the jaw muscles, which is also seen in gorillas and other animals, and is a characteristic of Bigfoot. The arms are longer than those of humans.

- Patterson/Gimlin&apos;s Bigfoot video footage matches the proportions in this photo.

<a href="../img/20220509_cmp.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220509_cmp.jpg" src="../img/20220509_cmp.jpg"></a>

<h3 id="my-view">My view</h3>
- Cliff Barackman is quite aggressive in claiming that a photograph of a person wearing a winter suit that covers the head is a photograph of Bigfoot. The triangle on the top of the head is merely a reflection of the shape of the head of the winter clothing.

- Comparing the image of a bent-over person, with no knees visible, with the image of the supposedly upright Bigfoot, and claiming that the proportions match is unconvincing.

- The recorded recordings of the witnesses&apos; statements show that they were realistic reactions.

<a href="../img/20220509_cmp2.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="20220509_cmp2.jpg" src="../img/20220509_cmp2.jpg"></a>


<h3 id="my-view">My view</h3>
- His interpretation is quite aggressive. The comparison image above alone makes it look similar, but the whole scene is shown below. It is indistinguishable from a thick branch of trees. He ignores the possibility that the witnesses are acting.
