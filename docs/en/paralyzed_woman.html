- The experience of a 30-year-old female patient (CT scan results showed no bleeding or trauma to the brain). This female patient&apos;s case was investigated by a physician who is also a researcher of UFO/occult phenomena.

- The patient&apos;s testimony is as follows: &quot;I went to the famous stone forest (ruins?) near the campsite. I visited the It was 56 km east of Lima.

- While exploring the area at night with my companions, we saw torchlight from a hut and heard music. We saw people dancing there.

- As she approached it, she felt a chill. She put her head inside through the open door and saw people dressed in 17th century clothing. She felt a chill. She tried to go inside, but her companions pulled her back. Immediately after, she became paralyzed on the right side of her body.

- An EEG showed that half of her brain, the left side of her brain, was not functioning properly.

- For the full story, buy my(Brent Raynes&apos;s) book.

<blockquote>
46:33
I&apos;ve just turned to page 139 and it was
46:42
a doctor roll rios Centeno both a researcher and
46:48
a physician and the subject was a thirty
46:54
year old patient of dr. Siddhant sentinels and i will quote it was it was
47:00
a very strange case of chemo plea gia since abroad examination with a cat scan
47:07
there were no areas showing bleeding vessels nor any traumatic lesions says
47:14
when i began okay when i began questioning the case the patient told me
47:21
the following I was at a campground in the vicinity of Makaha suhasi the famous
47:29
stone for us located some fifty six kilometres east of of Lima
47:35
when I went out exploring late at night with some friends oddly enough we heard us heard the strains of music and
47:42
noticed a small torch lit Shack I was able to see people dancing inside but
47:49
upon getting closer I felt a sudden sensation of cold which I paid a little
47:54
attention to and I stuck my head through an open door it was then that I saw the
48:00
occupants were clad in 17th century fashion I tried to enter the room but
48:05
one of my girlfriends pulled me out the patient was tucked out by one of her
48:11
friends and her body became paralysed and half precisely as she was drawn out
48:17
of the shack my conclusion is that the probable cause behind the hemo play Gia
48:23
is unknown no medical test was able to ascertain its cause nonetheless the EEG
48:30
was able to show that the left hemisphere of the brain did not show signs of normal functioning as well as
48:37
an abnormal amount of electric waves yeah yeah and if they want to know any
48:43
more they got to read the book and that is such a strange case because there&apos;s
48:50
there&apos;s actually like you know they followed it up with a medical exam obviously because she was you know

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
- The following is based on the assumption that the story of this incident was true.

<h3 id="solve-this-mystery">solve this mystery</h3>
- There must have been a strong EMF anomaly in the vicinity of this hut.

- A similar phenomenon has also occurred in &quot;Skinwalker ranch&quot;. As a result, the caretaker, Thomas Winterton, was hospitalized for several weeks with severe injuries to the parietal region of his head, including his brain. Brandon Fugal and his team, who found Thomas Winterton in a dazed state, also became dizzy and their electronic equipment malfunctioned (*1).

- The &quot;torchlight from a hut&quot; could have been a luminous phenomenon caused by an EMF anomaly, but &quot;people dressed in 17th century clothing,&quot; &quot;the sound of music,&quot; and &quot;people dancing&quot; were all probably hallucinations.

- The testimony of feeling cold can be interpreted as a hallucination or a phenomenon similar to the following.

　　<a href="http://news21c.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-19211.html" target="_blank">Skinwalker ranch also observed a drop in temperature with their instruments.</a> (2022-03-07)


- &quot;Immediately afterwards, she became paralyzed...EEG showed that half of her brain, the left side of her brain, was not functioning properly&quot;...The cause of this may be that she encountered a strong EMF abnormality that caused a permanent alteration in her brain. The reason why the alteration occurred only on the left side of the brain is that the left side of the brain was exposed to the strong EMF abnormality. In other words, the left brain absorbed most of the EMF anomalies (gamma rays are also a type of EMF anomaly), and the right brain was not affected.

- Many abductees have experienced frequent and repeated abductions since childhood, which may have been the result of the disruption of consciousness caused by this permanent alteration of the brain.

- Abduction runs in the family from generation to generation (e.g., grandmother to mother to daughter), probably because they grew up in the same house. If the family is EMF sensitive and the genetic constitution is sensitive to EMF, it is quite possible.

<h3 id="remaining-matter">remaining matter</h3>
- Like this case, I am beginning to wonder whether the EMF anomalies at the Skinwalker ranch (including gamma rays) could really be caused by the piezoelectric effect of the crust alone. It may be necessary to consider mechanisms other than the piezoelectric effect (*2). But even in that case, there should be no need for &quot;unknown intelligent beings&quot; to come into play.

<h4 id="2">(*2)</h4>
- For example, Anderson localization is a candidate, but I am not sure if it is sufficient.
